One of the only musical instruments actively approved of by the church of Tempus, the Cittern of War was constructed by a halfling instrument maker named Relias Blackseed. Priests of Arvoreen the Defender blessed the cittern with its impressive power. Relias never intended to play his magnificent creation. He eventually sold the ruddy instrument to a bard named Gallow Deely. Gallow was a lanky, slender man often found in the company of adventurers. Though ill-suited for battle, Gallow was exceptionally gifted at putting tales of heroism to music. With the aid of the cittern, he helped the Company of Frozen Trees defeat a young green dragon in 1013 DR. His song, commemorating the occasion, was a rollicking tune called “The Fight of Green Thirteen.” It is played in central and western taverns to this day.

These gaudy red and green boots were worn by the rogue Elpham of Perrywine. Elpham was a pickpocket of exceptional talent who pressed his luck by taunting his victims shortly after taking their loot. After being caught twice, Elpham invested his money in having these boots made. Of course, Elpham came to an untimely end when he picked the pocket of the notoriously ill-tempered Red Wizard of Thay, Xain Morobdel. Elpham stole a pouch full of gems off of Xain’s waist and danced off into the crowd shouting, “Why don’t you try to chase me back to the Priador, baldy? Ha ha!” Xain, quietly fuming, promptly summoned four invisible stalkers and commanded them to, “Kill the idiot in the red and green boots.”

Years ago when Baldur's Gate was a young city, there was an equaly youn mage known only as "Schlumpsha" studying at Candle Keep.  He had considerable power and was a competant mage in the school of enchantment.  When the time came for him to leave the Keep he was given a pair of magical boots by a "friend" and fellow enchanter.  the nature of the enchantment was to camaflage the wearer to look like one of the undead creatures infesting the  the sewers of the Gate.  Schlumpsha intended to  rid the sewers of the infestation and be a hero of the Gate.  But as he put the boots on he discovered a secondary enchantment, one that transformed his body to viral green slime. Though he kept his mind his body was now no longer human and he was forced to live the remainder  of his life as "Schlumpsha the Sewer King".  Bitter from his transformation he began to attack sewer workers and found that all he touched was charmed to his will.  To this day the Sewer King resides beneath the city amassing an army of followers to start a new era of slime and putresance.

Golems are powerful fighters, but the mage wanted a bodyguard that he could bring with him wherever he went and one that he could call forth to defend him in the blink of an eye. He created a sword that would float in the air and attack any enemies he commanded it to strike. 'Khal Abbil' means 
'trusted Friend' in the drow tongue.

For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round the victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid further damage. The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-foot radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. polymorph/paralyzation or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.

Although this magical mirth lasts only a single round, the affected creature must spend the next round regaining its feet, and it loses 2 points from its Strength (or -2 to attack and damage rolls) for all remaining rounds of the spell.~

The Hammer of Kharas or Hammer of Honor was one of the two artifacts originally required to forge the Dragonlance during the Third Dragon war. It can be used alone to forge a lesser dragonlance, or in combination with the Silver Arm of Ergoth to make a greater dragonlance. Legend stated that it was forged by Reorx, the patron God of the Dwarves and the Forger of the World. After the war, when Takhisis took her dragons from the world, it was kept by the Knights of Solamnia as a holy relic. Shortly before the Cataclysm, a young and heroic dwarven warrior fought with the Solamnics in one of the Kingpriest's wars to rid Ansalon of evil. The Solamnic knights were so impressed with this warrior that they named him Kharas or "knight" in Solamnic and they gave him the Hammer. Afterwards, Kharas returned to Thorbardin. Then the night of the Cataclysm came and the dwarves locked the gates to their kingdom and allowed no one, including their cousins the Hill Dwarves, to enter. The Hammer and Kharas stayed in Thorbardin until Fistandantilus and his army of humans and dwarves came to Zhaman. This became known as the Dwarfgate War. The pitting of dwarf against dwarf destroyed Kharas. He believed that all dwarves should get along in peace. However, Kharas was above all of a dwarf of honor and duty. So when High King Duncan gave orders to give battle, Kharas did not shirk his duty. The ensuing battle left both armies destroyed as Fistandantilus unleashed an unimaginable force of magic that shattered Zhaman turning it into Skullcap and ruining the Gate of Thorbardin. All were killed, except Kharas. The battle killed the heirs to the High King. So when High King Duncan passed, there was much fighting and bickering among the thanes over who would lead. Disgusted for the last time, Kharas took his hammer, declared that there would be no more true kings until his hammer was found, and left. The Hammer was found in the tomb of Duncan where the Heroes of the Lance recovered it. They used it as a bargaining chip to secure a place for the refugees of Pax Tharkas in Thorbardin.
The hammer itself multiplies the strength of the user.

Wyrmslayer is the sister blade to Wyrmsbane. It is the enchanted sword of the Elven king Kith-Kanan. It was magically crafted by elven mages. It has special powers against dragons. The pommel is set with a green jewel, the crosspiece looks like an eagle's beak, and elven script is written on it. In order to fend off the evil dragons attacking Silvanesti, Wyrmslayer was forged by the elves during the Second Dragon War. Kith-Kanan eventually used it during the Kinslayer Wars. It was taken with Kith-Kanan to Qualinesti and buried in the Sla-Mori with him. When the companions were in the Sla-Mori, specifically Kith-Kanan's tomb, on their way to Pax-Tharkas, they were ambushed by a giant slug-like monster. This monster attacked them, and it spit acid onto Tanis's sword, melting it. Left swordless, Tanis backed up onto the throne/burial place of Kith-Kanan, were he was then given the blade by Kith-Kanan himself. Tanis lost it when he gave it to Caramon at the Inn of the Red Dragon in Tarsis. The building collapsed, and later, when the sword was recovered, it was in the possession of Laurana and Sturm's group. It was stored in a chest. When Laurana retrieved the dragon orb in Qualin-mori, she was forced to leave Wyrmslayer. Later, Porthios, Laurana's brother, presented it to Tanis on the day that Laurana and Tanis were married.

Wyrmsbane is a longsword that was forged by elves during the Age of Might, also known as "Redeemer". It was lost after the Third Dragon War. Wyrmsbane is a weapon that easily kills Baaz Draconians, as it cannot be encased in their bodies. The blade can locate objects at the wielder's command up to three times per day. Wyrmsbane is the sister sword to Wyrmslayer. After the Heroes of the Lance aided Alhana Starbreeze in Silvanesti, Alhana presents Tanis with the sword. Tanis carries the sword until the Chaos War, where he dies. Later, a thief steals it off Tanis's grave and sells it to an ogre king, who in turn sells it to Dhamon Grimwulf. Dhamon attempts to use it to find a cure for the scale on his leg, but fails. After throwing it away, Fiona, a Solamnic Knight in his company, takes it. Maldred, also in Dhamon's company, infused it in a stone near where Fiona died.

@1157 = ~Whip +4~
@1158 = ~Whip +4

While a whip is not capable of inflicting substantial damage in combat, it can be very useful for disarming enemies, leaving them vulnerable to attacks by other weapons. Whips are generally of two main types, either a firm stick device designed to strike directly, or a flexible whip which must be swung in a specific manner to be effective, but has a longer reach. There are also whips which combine both a firm stick and a flexible line, such as hunting whips.

The majority of whips are designed for use on animals, although whips such as the "cat o' nine tails" and knout were designed specifially for flagellation of humans as a means of a corporal punishment or torture. Whips can be used consenually, or even by a person upon themselves as part of a religious practice, or for sexual fetishism.

Stock whips are a type of single-tailed leather whip with a very long lash but a short handle. Stock whips are primarily used to make a loud cracking sound to move livestock.

By cracking the whip near an enemy, it can cause them to go deaf for a short time

@1192 = ~Sword of Shannara~
@1193 = ~Sword of Shannara

The Sword of Shannara is a legendary weapon with a wondrous history. It was forged by Urprox Screl, the finest smith in all the Southland, with aid from an Old World formula provided by the outcast Cogline and the magic of the Druid Bremen, for the express purpose of destroying the Warlock Lord. As it takes the form of a blade, the talisman was named the Sword of Shannara. Bremen made the mistake of giving the sword to the elven King, Jerle Shannara, instead of to the elven people; this led the people to believe that only the heir of Shannara had the right to wield the sword. This led the people to believe that only the heir of Shannara had the right to wield the sword, making its power useless to all except his descendants.

In addition to this, the nature of the sword makes it possible to undermine the user's ability to wield it properly unless properly trained with the weapon. As a protection against this, it is actually important not to be told of the sword's power until after coming into possession of it. This is because the sword will reveal the absolute truth about a person wielding it and if the person cannot deal with the revelations, they might not be permanently harmed, but the blade is unusable to them.

Jerle Shannara used the sword in the Second War of the Races against The Warlock Lord. He was unable to wield the talisman properly, and could not garner the Sword's full power. As a result, the Warlock Lord was beaten and the second War of the Races ended, but Brona escaped. The Sword was then placed in a block of Tre-Stone and taken to Paranor. It was later stolen by the Warlock Lord's minions, but then recovered by Jerle Shannara's last heir, Shea Ohmsford, who finally defeated the Warlock Lord. Shea then gave it to the city of Tyrsis, where it was kept in a vault for the next 300 years. It later disappeared, to be recovered by Par Ohmsford, who used it in battle with the Shadowen. The Sword was used next by Bek Ohmsford, who carried it during his journey to Parkasia. The Sword was then given to Grianne Ohmsford. Depending on which scholar you are speaking to, their are amany theories as to what happened to the sword after that time.

The Eilt Druin medallion was forged into the hilt, and the truth of Druids past is infused within its blade. The Sword has the power to reveal the truth about anything, from a person to a magical force. It was this power that destroyed the Warlock Lord since he was only alive because of the depth of his belief that he was immortal. This was however not possible, the Sword forced him to see and acknowledge that truth, thus killing him.~
@1194 = ~Dragon Kite Shield~
@1195 = ~Dragon Kite Shield

The kite shield was an evolution in the development of shields, representing a change in the popular circular shape which had been dominant. It was either a reverse teardrop shape or later on, flat-topped. The tapering point extended down to either a distinct or rounded point. It was either flat in section, or featured a gradual curve, to better fit the contour of the human torso, much in the style of a scutum.

The kite shield predominantly features enarmes, leather straps used to grip the shield tight to the arm. Unlike a boss, or centralised grip, this allows a greater degree of weight distribution along the arm, rather than the weight pulling on the wrist. Kite shields were strapped in a variety of different patterns, such as a simple left-right grip (where the left side strap is looser than the right, thus allowing an arm to be slid in and then grip the right strap), top-bottom (the same configuration but with the loose strap below the tight strap) and various cross-bracing (where two straps meet in an x shape). All these types of grips have appeared on various illuminated manuscripts, and it appears to have been a matter of preference which was used. The shield sometimes featured a boss, a large domed metal centrepiece, but is has been generally accepted that, unlike on earlier shields where this was a form of grip, it was merely decorative. It is also taken that a large number of kite shields featured no boss, and this was also a matter of preference. The shield was usually made from stout but light wood, such as lime, and faced in either leather or toughened fabric, such as canvas. Most shields featured some form of reinforced rim, generally toughened leather, although some historians believe the rims on certain shields would have been constructed from metal. It could also be slung across the back with a guige strap when not in use.~

The Staff was lost to the world when the city was thrown down a mountainside during the Cataclysm. The Staff was discovered again when a barbarian named Riverwind was sent on a quest to find knowledge of the true gods by the chieftain of his people, the father of his beloved Goldmoon. Upon returning to his village, Riverwind was denounced as a charlatan, and ordered stoned to death. Goldmoon, staff in hand, ran to be with him. As the rocks hit them both, the staff flashed bright blue, and the two were transported to the outskirts of the town of Solace.

The Staff was sought by the forces of evil who feared that knowledge of the good gods could hurt their efforts to conquer the world, but the Heroes of the Lance protected Goldmoon and the Staff until they eventually came to Xak Tsaroth. There Goldmoon returned the Staff to its proper place (the staff fused with the statue and became rock) and was made a true cleric of Mishakal with the innate ability to heal without the use of the Staff.~

@1253 = ~Basilisk's Gift~
@1254 = ~Basilisk's Gift

Also known as the Scimitar of Petrification, the origin of this blade is odd indeed. The blade gained its petrification abilites when a wildmage cast a spell on an adventurer who wielded the blade in battle against a Basilisk. The Original owner sadly perished in the fight, but later the sword was found to turn whatever it struck into stone.~

@1257 = ~Celestial Fire~
@1258 = ~Celestial Fire

"Celestial Fire" is the only object that Trias has left to remind him of the Upper Planes. This heavy blade is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the blade. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the sword seems to be burning with metallic flames... someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the blade is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver.

The sword looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat.

@1259 = ~Defender of Dorn's Deep~
@1260 = ~Defender of Dorn's Deep

This is a heavily reinforced suit of dwarven-sized full plate mail armor.  Its construction appears to be a rushed job--some plates don't quite come together perfectly and some of the angles are odd.  Closer inspection reveals that the armor is constructed of an alloy of adamantite, mithril, and meteoric iron the likes of which you have never before encountered.
Created after the dissolution of the Cooperation just over two centuries ago, this armor was indeed hastily designed and created in only two weeks by a team of master dwarven armorsmiths.  The ultra-heavy armor was to be used by Daag Anvilsmasher, the best dwarven fighter in Dorn's Deep, against the invading Horde of Darkness.  Fortunately, Daag was able to don the armor and allow the escape of dozens of his fellows; unfortunately, even this wonderful armor was unable to prevent his death.  Strangely enough, he did rout his immediate attackers--some of their weapons had become lodged in his armor and these held him upright after his death; thinking him incapable of dying they broke ranks and ran.

PENALTIES
The heavy, inaccurate fit of the armor reduces movement rate by 1, weapon attack speed by 1, and dexterity by 1.

SPECIAL
The Defender grants 25% resistance to physical attacks.
The wearer is immune to panic, fatigue, and being pushed around.

@1267 = ~The Sword of Days

This short sword was crafted by highly skilled halfling weapon smiths in conjunction with three priests of Urogalan, the Black Hound. The priests of the god of the dead commissioned and enchanted the sword for a famous halfling adventurer named Eriadon Oakhollow. Eriadon was well known for his fight against those who would defile the tombs of his people. The sword has a dull, even blade with deep engraving on one side. The engraving is in Thorass and lists, in various tables, all of the days of a tenday, months of the year, cycles of the moon, major halfling festivals and observances, and the years of Eriadon’s life. The other side of the blade simply features the maker’s mark, a black hound’s head, and the words “THE SWORD OF DAYS.” Tarnished silver in the engraving lines keeps the words and images dark. Upon Eriadon’s death, the sword was passed on to a traveling priest of Arvoreen the Defender who is believed to have died fighting goblins in the High Moor.

@1305 = ~Longclaw~
@1306 = ~Longclaw

For five centuries the Valyrian steel sword Longclaw was carried by the Lords of Bear Island in the service of the Starks of Winterfell. Passed from father to son, the hand-and-a-half sword - called a bastard sword by the uncouth - had a great history while in their possession. That came to an end, however, when the last lord of the House, Jorah Mormont, was disgraced and fled Lord Stark's justice. Jorah went into exile, but left behind the sword which then found its way back to his father, Jeor, the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

Longclaw was kept out of sight, until the fateful night came when a wight - a dead man brought to life by creatures out of nightmarish legend - sought to throttle the Old Bear in his sleep. It was his steward, Jon Snow, and Snow's albino direwolf Ghost who rescued him by setting the wight ablaze. Though part of Lord Jeor's apartments were burned down following this, the fire would need to have burned a hundred times hotter to harm the blade that was forged in old Valyria before the Doom. The ancient silver bear's head pommel and the hilt was burned, but these were replaced at the Old Bear's command with something befitting Snow. Given the sword, now adorned with a wolf's head pommel, and the opportunity to rename it as a gift. Jon Snow responded that wolves have claws just as bears do, and kept the proud name as it was.~

@1309 = ~Pigface Bascinet~
@1310 = ~Pigface Bascinet

Commonly used by both the knightly class and infantry soldiers, this helmet style has become popular as of late, quickly replacing the Great Helm because the rounder shape gives the pigface a closer more secure fit and the conical shapes provide better glancing surfaces and  superior protection to the eyes against arrows and lances. Typically fitted with an aventail and hinged visor, the visors have two eye slits and another slit, or slits, at the level of the mouth. There are numerous breathing holes on the right side of the visor, but in most but not all cases, none or few on the left side. This is consistent with the idea that the opponent's lance was going to strike the left side, so that the bascinet was designed to offer the minimum number of places where the opponent's lance could catch, and likely to also minimize the risk of denting or damaging the visor and subsequently the wearer.The long snouted appearance had earned it the nickname "hound skull", or Pig-face bascinet.~

Also known as Gonturan, this was the sword of Angharad "Harry" Crewe, the Homelander orphan girl who became Harimad-sol, King's Rider and was the first woman to have wielded since the Lady Aerin bore it into battle. It that it can only be used by a damalur-sol, a woman hero and is both a symbol of power an amplifier of magic. It is also a sword with a mind of its own.~
@1315 = ~Woundhealer~
@1316 = ~Woundhealer

One of the Twelve Swords of Power, Woundhealer is also called the Sword of Mercy, and less frequently, the Sword of Love, and even more infrequently, the Sword of Healing. It bears an open human hand engraved in white on its hilt.

Woundhealer's verse in The Song of Swords describes its power as follows:

    Whose flesh the Sword of Mercy hurts has drawn no breath,
    Whose soul it heals has wandered in the night,
    Has paid the summing of all debts in death
    Has turned to see returning light. 

Woundhealer is the only Sword incapable of killing, though it can cut and hack inanimate matter as well as any of the other Swords. Instead, when living flesh is pierced with the Blade, it has a powerful healing effect. The Sword can knit broken bones, heal disease, fix genetic disorders, regenerate lost limbs, and repair mental or psychological problems (including the effects of Soulcutter). Properly employed, it can enable its user to sustain extensive damage without dying. Its healing effect can prevent amputation of entire limbs if the Sword is in active use; the blade heals the wound before the attack can complete its path across the limb, and before the wound can start to bleed.

The sensation of Woundhealer cutting or piercing an individual is described as a sort of exquisite pain. When in action, Woundhealer emits a sound similar to a human sigh. Woundhealer works on any living thing, human or animal. It is not known to restore the dead to life.

Woundhealer is not explicitly stated to project a healing aura. In most cases, the blade must come into contact and break the skin of the person being healed. Woundhealer can be self administered. The time of effect depends on the severity of injury or sickness, and proximity of the Blade to the problem area. While Woundhealer can eventually repair a broken leg by being stuck into the patient's heart, the healing is instantaneous when it is sliced through the affected limb.

Woundhealer is the only Sword that has survived an encounter with Shieldbreaker, although the circumstances were unusual. The Sword was plunged into the heart of Prince Mark, the son of the god-like Emperor, at the time Mark's opponent attacked with Shieldbreaker. Instead of destroying Woundhealer, Shieldbreaker was obliterated. The result was explained as occurring because Woundhealer was combined with the strongest weapon of all, the human heart.

It also is called the Sword of Love. At one point the Sword was thrust through the heart of two people. While the two remained in love for the rest of their lives, it is unknown whether the Sword was responsible.~

Faldorn showed great promise as she approached adulthood, and the order decided to send her to the Sword Coast to test her devotion to their ideals. Her ongoing mission is to use any means available to stop the despoiling of nature, no matter the risk or the cost to her life or any other's. She later became the leader of the Shadow Druids in the grove near Trademeet. So consumed by her cause has she become, that Faldorn scarcely recalls any past dealing with you.

The armor may be worn by thieves with few penalties and by fighter-mages without removing their spellcasting ability.

@1657 = ~Gnomish Mecha Armor

Within the gnomish community, there is a constant competition between all craftsmen, among both masters and apprentices, with actual categories such as, most items carried, best personal trap, most secure pouch, nicest appearance, and so forth.  These contests are held on high festival days, much like a merchant's bazaar as another guild tradition to confuse the newcomer or overnight visitor.

In the largest of clans, many competing craftsman's guilds might sponsor and support individual designs or candidates. Every craftsman in the hall will spend long nights tinkering with his own armor to emulate or duplicate the desired effect. Those who succeed will claim partial credit for testing and perfecting the basic design. Those who fail might offer small sums of gold for the secret of the new invention. This armor won the blue ribbon for best design last year. It has yet to be mass produced, but any gnome lucky enough to get their hands on it will be very pleased.~

Borivyk, who sells animals in the Water Gardens, once again needed my help. He needs to please a rich client who has come up with a whim - to get a more interesting pet than cats and dogs.

@1845 = ~New Animal Trouble

One of the circus workers was in a good mood, and he just gave us a snake. According to him, she is harmless.

I should go back to Borivyk and see if this snake will work.~

@1846 = ~New Animal Trouble

It was to be expected that the snake is not the best gift for a spoiled rich woman. But where to find an outlandish pet for her? Borivik suggested that it is worth asking again those who have recently returned from distant lands....~

At least that's the story that Master Dilindal himself tells.

Well, if the beautiful and worthy lady who will wear it does not care much about the beauty of the tiara, then it's powerful enchantments will definitely not doubt the value of this graceful artifact.

Oddly enough, the perfume is really good. According to the deceased himself, it not only has an exquisite aroma, but can also remove curses.

The fact is that even those who do not understand anything about magic can still use a sapphire, and when the general public found out about this, the number of people wishing to take possession of such a valuable artifact increased dramatically.

Cyric was not going to endow him with such power, he did not even know about the existence of Tiax before that meeting in the Pocket Plane. Cyric's plans were too grand for the little gnome to find a place in them. How could you trust the Prince of Lies and not be deceived?

Despite that, fate turned out to be merciful to Tiax. For a long time he wandered through the forests and cities that he so dreamed of ruling, trying to figure out what to do next. He eventually returned to Athkatla to visit the circus he knew, hoping that the legendary flying white elephants would finally appear there. There he ran into his old acquaintance, the merchant Jan Jansen, who invited Tiax to tea. The little cleric of Cyric was so hungry that he did not even argue and agreed. While there, sipping turnip tea and eating turnip cakes, he met Jan's cousin, it was a dwarf girl named Clotilde. When Tiax saw her, he was confused, because he felt something that he had never experienced before. Also she, too, was happy that she met a famous hero and companion of the Child of Bhaal. So the story of their love began, which deserves a separate chronicle. They soon got married and settled in a small house in the Slums area, next to Jan's.

Once missing the battles and travels, he went down to the dungeons under the Copper Coronet, where he had already been in the old days. There he met a group of kobolds. Tiax had already prepared for battle - he had the Shaman's Staff in his hands. Seeing the miraculous staff, the kobolds bowed before Tiax and acknowledged his authority and agreed to serve him. He easily mastered the trick of creating good berries, and the kobolds began to consider him their god. So Tiax found in Athkatla not only a wife, but also grateful listeners, listening to his every word. Gradually, thanks to the miracle of Clotilde's love, his mind began to heal, and the evil spirit of Cyric left him forever, but that's another story...~

In addition, he told everyone that without him <CHARNAME> could not have achieved anything and it was he who dealt the decisive blow to the evil witch Melissan. Nobody could check this, so everyone believed in his words. To work with Quayle was now considered an honor for the outstanding entertainers and trainers who were queuing up to get a job at his circus. Trained wyverns, acrobats, fire eaters, renowned magicians - There was entertainment for every taste! Athkatla's circus soon became famous not only in Amn, but also in other lands.

Over time, Quayle bought himself a house in the Government District, married a wealthy but stupid noble widow, and was even elected to the Council of Six!

When the story of <CHARNAME> came to an end, Faldorn stopped arguing with herself and began to do what her soul asked again. She returned to the forests and led a group of Shadow Druids in Tethyr, gradually increasing their influence. There were many worries and many battles with people who encroached on the forest expanses of these lands, but she could not live any other way. Through her example of steadfastness and faith in the Great Oak Father, she inspired other Shadow Druids.

In one of the battles with the soldiers sent to protect the lumberjack camp, Faldorn was badly wounded and died among the trees that she always protected, and which were her only love in life. Her last words were an appeal to her followers: “Do not forget what I have taught you, friends: Walk with rage against all who threaten the Great Mother.”~

@8003 = ~Coran and Safana’s romance continued after the journey to the Throne of Bhaal. This is an example of such a union, over which neither time, nor the difference in their characters, nor adversity has power. Fate intertwined the threads of their destinies into a single knot.

Coran often recalled his daughter, Namara, whom he once left with his former lover, Brielbara. He tried not to show it and maintain his usual cheerfulness, but Safana understood him perfectly and saw what he wanted. She invited him to go and see his daughter together, and they did so. It turned out that Brielbara had already died of some kind of illness, and Namara was living in an orphanage. Seeing her, Coran felt that this was the most important moment in his life and that a decision had to be made that would affect everything. He was no longer such a frivolous rake as before - During his travels with a Child of Bhaal, Coran learned to appreciate what fate presents him, and mentally developed for the better because of it. Therefore, he did not hesitate, and looking at Safana, realized that she had read his thoughts and agreed with him. They took Namara out of the orphanage and became good parents to her.

Then they often traveled, there were many difficulties, but they never parted. It was a happy family.

Coran and Safana’s story was sung by bards all over the Sword Coast as an example of how true love can connect even the most restless souls and bring goodness and mercy to this cruel world...~ 

@8004 = ~Safana's story remains inextricably linked with the story of her beloved, Coran. She increasingly noticed that he was sad about his daughter Namara, whom he had previously left with her mother. Although he tried to maintain his usual cheerfulness, Safana was ready to support her beloved in any of his decisions. During her travels, she used to have many love affairs, but only with the Coran did she understand what true love is, in which the happiness of a loved one is a guarantee of happiness for yourself. Therefore, she herself invited him to visit Namara together, although deep down she feared that, having seen his daughter, he might want to return to his former lover Brielbara. But when they arrived, they learned that Brielbara died after a serious illness, and Coran's daughter was living in an orphanage. Safana supported Coran in his decision to take a daughter with him, and over time she fell in love with Namara like her own daughter, whom she never had.

Then they often traveled, there were many difficulties, but they never parted. It was a happy family.

@8005 = ~After the end of this story, Montaron traveled to Zhentil Keep to report back to Lord Manshoon about the completion of his assignment. Revealing everything he had learned about the Child of Bhaal, and to bring him the severed head of Melissan. Melissan crossed the path of the Black Network and therefore they could not allow her to gain the power that she dreamed of. This was Montaron's special mission that no one knew about.

No one else has ever saw him since. Perhaps he had enemies in Zhentarim, and they persuaded Lord Manshoon to deal with him, or maybe he was just sent on a new mission, to another part of Faerun. Nobody knows the truth. Even Montaron's colleague Xzar could not answer anything intelligible when asked where Montaron was, and began to laugh madly...~

No one else has ever saw him since. Perhaps he had enemies in Zhentarim, and they persuaded Lord Manshoon to deal with him, or maybe he was just sent on a new mission, to another part of Faerun. Nobody knows the truth. <CHARNAME> for some strange reason fell in love with this cruel killer and tried for a long time to find him, but she failed. Even Montaron's colleague Xzar could not answer anything intelligible when asked where Montaron was, and began to laugh madly...~

@8007 = ~Xzar became increasingly insane as he traveled to the Throne of Bhaal, and no one could influence him. Reasonable thoughts began to appear less and less, and manic more and more. Even his closest associates were uncomfortable when they had to go to bed next to him - No one knew what would come to this madman's head next time and which of those who fell asleep would wake up alive. The Zhentarim also stopped giving him new tasks when they realized that he was becoming out of control.

After the death of Melissan, he never returned to his home in Athkatla, because too many knew him there and were already beginning to guess who was behind the series of murders at the docks and other unsolved crimes. He moved first to one city, then to another, and by a strange coincidence - Soon after that inhabitants began to disappear in these cities, and corpses without entrails and many parts of the body began to be found in the ditches. Although most often the victims were prostitutes and vagabonds, so the authorities turned a blind eye to these murders, preferring to deal with those incidents where wealthy citizens suffered. After a while the murders stopped ... So that later they would continue in other cities. No one managed to catch the monstrous maniac, but at some point the murders stopped by themselves.

Xzar lived a long life and died peacefully in Riatavin, in a hospital for the mentally ill - He was placed there after complaints from neighbors about his screams. He was buried in the hospital cemetery, with honor and observance of all rituals. He was considered just an old man out of his mind, and no one even guessed who he really was and what a terrible darkness reigned in his soul.~ 

@8008 = ~After the story of the Bhaalspawns was over, Kagain returned to Athkatla and continued to trade in his shop. During his travels, he made many new acquaintances and acquired a lot of treasures, so his business flourished more and more, and his connections with the Cowled Wizards and mercenaries made it easy to eliminate serious competitors.

The only thing that brought him joy in life was money, and there was no better place to make it than the City of Coins. Gradually, Kagain expanded his influence beyond Athkatla and began to trade throughout Amn, opening a whole trading network, but retaining its old name - "Kagain's Corner". While rumors circulated about his not entirely legal methods of action, many respected this old and wealthy dwarf. Over time, he even received a title of nobility and entered the circle of the city nobility. He was often seen at Lady Goldsword's parties in the Water Gardens. However only his closest people noticed that sometimes a strange expression appeared in the eyes of the old dwarf - When he talked about his old shop in Beregost about his past adventures, and how he, along with the hero of the Sword Coast named <CHARNAME>, found treasures in dungeons...~ 

@8009 = ~Shar-Teel Dosan felt joy at only one thing in her life - Fighting. When the story of the Child of Bhaal came to an end, she returned to the implementation of her ambitious plan - To kill all the remaining Nightbringers of Shar in order to remain the last of them and gain all the power of the Mistress of the Night, and then destroy the Weave itself. After the War of Avatars, the Nightbringers remained few, and Shar-Teel slaughtered the remaining ones, one by one. " There can only be ONE," she liked to say.

Everything else in life; Love, friendship and motherhood, was alien and unknown to her. The tragedy that happened to her as a child took everything from her. There was only pain, rage and desire to prove to everyone her strength. The blow of the sword that killed her mother, in fact, «killed» Shar-Teel herself, destroying her soul and her childhood, and the evil spirit of Shar filled the void in her soul. Although Shar-Teel would have pierced anyone with a sword who told her about it.

She never doubted her success and was not afraid of anything, and challenged anyone who got in her way. Although her self-confidence ruined her. One night, on her way to Silverymoon, she encountered the Nightbringer who surpassed her in strength and skill. The face of this terrible warrior was hidden behind a mask, and no one knew his name. Shar-Teel did not flinch and drew her sword from its sheath. A battle began that could have gone down in legends if someone had seen it. After a long fight Shar-Teel felt for the first time in her life that she was weakening and losing concentration. She didn't have time to deflect the next blow, which pierced her through and through. However, dying, she did not regret anything - After all, she dreamed of such a death. It was death in fair battle and at the hands of a strong warrior whom she respected. His name and further fate remained shrouded in secrecy.

Shar-Teel's body was found in the morning by the local clerics of Lathander, who buried her, although they did not know who it was. At her humble grave, they prayed that the soul of this woman would finally find peace.~

@8010 = ~Bard Garrick, a former member of the Dale Wind Troubadours, traveled on his donkey throughout Faerun for a long time, singing ballads about his bravery and how he, with his faithful assistant named <CHARNAME>, destroyed the Throne of Bhaal and did not allow the evil god to rise. Ladies in all cities gasped with delight, listening to stories of his courage and invincibility, and gave him their kisses. Competitors were afraid to compete with him and left the city as soon as they heard the news that Sir Garrick was coming there.

Gradually his fame expanded, and now even the kings considered it an honor to invite such a famous bard, hero and savior of the world to their palace. Over time, he decided that it was time to pass on his experience to the young, and opened a special Academy of Bards in Baldur's Gate, where he taught young talented musicians the skills of singing and seducing women. The disciples listened to every word of the hero - The brave Sir Garrick.~

@8011 = ~After all his adventures with the Child of Bhaal, Yeslick returned to Athkatla and again worked for Skie in her Silver Dragons merchant guild. His fighting skills and wisdom greatly helped in the affairs of the guild. He was a reliable partner and Skie trusted him with many tasks; From guarding caravans to negotiating on behalf of the guild with the Cowled Wizards and the city authorities. When Skie left Athkatla, she left the guild under his full control. Soon, Yeslick met the woman he married and they settled in a house in the Bridge area. They lived there modestly, but happily. The old dwarf often recalled his early days and told his children about them. He also dreamed that one day the surviving members of his clan would regroup and revive his Orothiar clan...~

@8012 = ~After completing the story at the Throne of Bhaal, Skie Silvershield returned to Athkatla and continued to rule her Silver Dragons merchant guild. The guild was doing so well that the name Silvershield became even more famous. Skie left the guild under the control of Yeslick Orothiar, her longtime friend, and returned in triumph to her father at Baldur's Gate.

However, although her father greeted her with joy, her soul demanded adventure, and Skie could not stay out of work for a long time. Soon she returned to Athkatla and decided to fulfill her long-standing plan - To go on an expedition in search of the island of the Twelve Eyes. She had heard the sailors that sail the Seas of Ishtar tell tales of the Isle of the Twelve-Eyed Thing. Legend has it that there is a temple on the island with enough gold, diamonds and jewels inside, that you could buy several kingdoms with it. Skie questioned the sailors in the Docks area for a long time and finally one of the sailors told her that he had seen an old map on which an island with that name was marked. What is on it, no one knows, because the coast of the island is surrounded by dangerous reefs and not a single captain wanted to risk his ship for the sake of old tales. Hearing this, Skie could not resist the temptation. Having spent a lot of money, she bought a ship, gathered a team of sailors and went with them on a dangerous expedition.

Many adventures lay ahead of her, but traveling with <CHARNAME> hardened her character. What she faced on the island, and how she steadfastly overcame all the trials and returned back to the docks of Athkatla with a ship loaded with gold so that it almost sank on the way, now that's a different story...~

@8013 = ~After all her adventures with the Child of Bhaal, Branwen was summoned to the Temple of Tempus in Easthaven for a gathering of the Arch-Clerics. There she was asked to explain about everything that happened and how <CHARNAME>, with her help, managed to stop the revival of an ancient evil on the Throne of Bhaal. Branwen told the Arch-Clerics about everything, while without exaggerating her merits, she spoke simply and with respect. Even the elders were impressed by both her deeds and nobility and her humility. Few of the men have proven themselves as worthy as she. Therefore, the priests, after consulting, decided that from that moment Branwen could fulfill her old dream - To become a priestess and serve Tempus in her homeland. This was an unprecedented event, for there had never been a female priestess on the Moonshae Isles of Norheim. So Branwen helped everyone to revise old ideas about the world and open hearts and minds to a new one. With that, they managed to do this largely thanks to the hero named <CHARNAME>.~

@8014  = ~Alora did not leave Edwin after the completion of their wanderings. Remaining, as she said, his devoted friend. After the Thayvian 's infamous duel with Elminster, the halfling hired herself in his tavern and now helps the mage in all matters. In the evenings, the aged couple likes to sit by the fireplace for a long time and remember the old days. Sometimes, in the dim twilight of the room, Alora sees a smile flickering on Edwina's face, and then she smiles happily and joyfully in return.~

@8015  = ~Alora never returned to Iraebor, where her relatives lived. She continued her wanderings after parting with the Child of Bhaal. The spirit of adventure led her deeper and deeper into the continent, to wild and little-explored places. She was last seen in Vaasa, where the halfling offered her services to a small group of adventurers, who soon vanished without a trace in the endless forests of this inhospitable land.~

@8016 = ~After parting with <CHARNAME>, Nalia and Garrick wandered the roads of Faerun for a long time, doing good deeds, gaining experience and improving each one in their skills. Afterwards, in the end, they returned to Athkatla, they already had something to present to this spoiled city of luxury and power. Nalia d'Arnise reached great heights in the art of magic, but she did not cease to worry about issues of social injustice, and she took up politics. Soon, Nalia gained respect and weight in society, especially since Garrick, already a renowned bard, did not spare bright colors, or singing the praises of his beloved. The title of archmage and the ascent to the heights of power awaited her. Yet, these lovers still found the highest happiness in each other's company. They lived happily ever after.~

@8017 = ~After parting with <CHARNAME>, Garrick and Nalia wandered the roads of Faerun for a long time, doing good deeds, gaining experience, and improving each one in their skills. When, in the end, they returned to Athkatla, they already had something to present to this spoiled city of luxury and power. Garrick's dream came true; he became a very famous writer and poet. His book, surprisingly truthful (Not without the influence of Nalia) describing the adventures of the Child of Bhaal, was a huge success. No less popular were Garrick's sonnets, in which he, having finally mastered the art of real love poetry, sincerely and with inspiration sang to his beloved Nalia d'Arnise. Nalia herself by that time had become a strong magician, gained respect and weight in society and took up politics. Yet, these lovers still found the greatest happiness in each other's company. They lived happily ever after.~

@8018  = ~Deekin... What was he really, this little naive kobold-bard, kobold-killer of gods? Have all the events around the Throne of Bhaal already been erased from his memory, or has he never forgotten anything? Few people know the truth even now.

With Deekin's travel with the Bhaalspawn finished, he was gifted <CHARNAME>'s journal entries of all their adventures from that one fateful night outside Candlekeep to the final battle at the Throne of Bhaal. Deekin returned north to his native land. It was not the best decision in his life - the white dragon Timofarrar, to whom the Deekin tribe obeyed, spotted an unusual bard and made him something like his personal jester. Entertaining the owner with songs and tales, the kobold was afraid to tell the dragon that he traveled with the strongest of the offspring of the god of Murder and preferred not to mention it at all. He soon gained his freedom through an unusual encounter... and once again set out on an adventure as the helper of a brave hero who was destined to leave a mark on history. About the bright events experienced during the new wanderings, Deekin wrote two books.

He also managed to visit the leader and shaman of his tribe, strengthened his relationship with people. But the kobold bard wanted adventure, and Deekin traveled north to the city of Neverwinter were he would set up a small store selling both his books and wares collected from his numerous journeys to aspiring adventurers. It was in this role Deekin would meet the young captain of Crossroad Keep and experience the events of the war of Shadows the would follow. This would however be Deekin's last adventure as the now elderly kobold was listed amongst the dead during the King of Shadows attack on both Keep and the city that followed. 

Like many bards Deekin's works would far out live him and his works would be preserved in libraries all over Faerun for future scholars to study over. One set of his works is said to be displayed in a bedroom of certain former resident of Candlekeep. Even in death at his boss's side.~

@8019 = ~Ajantis Ilvastar returned to Athkatla after leaving <CHARNAME>. Wanderings with the child of Bhaal tempered his character, but did not harden his heart. Kindness and sincere compassion attracted people to him more than his courage and military prowess. Over the years, Ajantis realized that the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, which he so admired in his youth, was not as perfect as he thought. Being naturally soft-spoken, unable to fight corruption, Ajantis now tried to stay as far away from the order as possible, spending more and more time on campaigns and wanderings. Even through all his tribulations, Ajantis's devotion to Helm did not weaken at all. 

Ajantis married late, to a simple kind woman, ready to wait as long as she wanted for her husband from the next campaign. Although in the eyes of his relatives this marriage was a misalliance, but the paladin found his happiness; he now had someone to return to.~
