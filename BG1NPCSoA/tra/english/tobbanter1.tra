@0    = ~Tell me about, Shar-Teel.~
@1    = ~Shar-Teel Dosan is the daughter of Angelo Dosan, who was one of Sarevok's servants. She was born in a small village outside Baldur's Gate and lived peacefully until her mother was killed by raiders. Developing a deep sense of hatred towards men as a result, she dedicated her life to Shar after that tragic incident.~
@2    = ~As one of the few Nightbringers left in the world after the Avatar Wars decimated their numbers, she is a ruthless killer and a master with a sword. After helping <CHARNAME> during the Iron Crisis, she became a champion gladiator, slaying many monstrous foes in the Battle Pits of the Copper Coronet in Athkatla.~
@3    = ~Hmmm... You are not as stupid as I first suspected.~
@4    = ~Tell me about, Branwen.~
@5    = ~Branwen, a Cleric of Tempus from the Moonshae Isles, left her home of Seawolf at an early age, reviled by her own people for wanting to become a priest, a station reserved exclusively for the men of the village.~
@6    = ~She traveled the coast, offering her services to local militias, and eventually came into the employ of an adventuring troupe in the Nashkel area. Branwen had no idea that the group was participating in banditry however, and on their first raid, she balked at attacking a caravan of unarmed merchants. She rebelled and a mage named Tranzig turned her to stone in the ensuing fight.~
@7    = ~After being saved by <CHARNAME>, she traveled with <PRO_HIMHER> during the Iron Crisis, playing a crucial part in helping to save the city of Baldur's Gate with here fighting prowess and healing skills.~
@8    = ~I knew Tempus would one day reward my actions.. and thanks to you Volo, my deeds will be immortalized for all time.~
@9    = ~Tell me about, Yeslick.~
@10   = ~After the floods that decimated Clan Orothiar of the Cloakwood, Yeslick traveled to Sembia to start a new life. There he made the acquaintance of Rieltar, a member of the Iron Throne, and was hired as a personal smith.~
@11   = ~They became friends, and eventually Yeslick told Rieltar the location of his clan's long abandoned ore mine. Rieltar betrayed his supposed friend and locked him in a cell to die.~
@12   = ~However, Yeslick was freed from his cell by <CHARNAME> and later helped save Baldur's Gate.~
@13   = ~Aye! Yer history is spot on, though yer style is a bit horse dung.~
@14   = ~At least the history of what happened to me clan shall not be forgotten though, and hopefully others may learn from our mistakes.~
@15   = ~Tell me about, Garrick.~
@16   = ~You mean Garrick.. formerly of the the Dale Wind Troubadours? I have not heard word or whim of him since he left the group.~
@17   = ~What? How is it possible that you have not heard of the epic adventures of Brave sir Garrick? Grab a quill and parchment, good man, we have much work that needs to be done!~ [garrickp]
@18   = ~Tell me about, Skie Silvershield.~
@19   = ~Ah yes, young Skie Silvershield, daughter of Entar Silvershield, one of the Grand Dukes of Baldur’s Gate.~
@20   = ~After leaving behind the sheltered life she enjoyed in Baldur's gate, she became the leader of her own merchant guild, the Silver Dragons and prospered on her own.~
@21   = ~Could not have said it better myself.~
@22   = ~Bring me Shar-Teel, the amazonian gladiator.~
@23   = ~Bring me, Branwen, the Cleric of Tempus.~
@24   = ~Bring me, Yeslick, the dwarven cleric  of Moradin and Clangeddin Silverbeard.~
@25   = ~Bring me, Skie Silvershield, the successful merchant.~
@26   = ~Bring me, Garrick, the free-spirited bard.~
@27   = ~Bring me, Eldoth, the sleazy, thrill-seeking bard.~
@28   = ~When I first saw you, I took you for cowards. I guess I was right. Good riddance.~
@29   = ~Let's not split up just yet.~
@30   = ~Just wait here until I need you.~
@31   = ~Wait in the pocket plane until I come to get you.~
@32   = ~I'll prove my worth! It won't be too hard in this group.~
@33   = ~Do not try my patience! I will wait for a time, but I have no tolerance of ungrateful dogs.~
@34   = ~You have returned. Are you missing my warrior skills yet? Ha! Let's get going then.~
@35   = ~Not so fast. I don't need you just yet.~
@36   = ~Yes, join with me again.~
@37   = ~If you're too stupid to see my worth then that's your problem.~
@38   = ~Make no mistake.. I follow you only because of your prowess in battle. When that falters, so does my loyalty.~
@39   = ~So your destiny has led us here, to this miserable heap of camel dung, has it? How fitting..~
@40   = ~I should have expected as much for any one born of the God of the scum pools.~
@41   = ~You are welcome to leave whenever you desire.~
@42   = ~And that bitch Shar is any better?~
@43   = ~Watch your tone, Shar-Teel.~
@44   = ~Ha! If it was not for me protecting you, the buzzards would have been picking your bones clean in the desert.~ [shartw]
@45   = ~If you are going to try and control me, you will need more than words, Bhaalspawn.~
@46   = ~The difference, Bhaalspawn, is that Shar is not some dying god, desperately trying to have a child to cling unto glory. The avatar of Shar will bring down the Shadow Weave, and your feeble father along with it.~
@47   = ~So this is fabled metropolis of Saradush.. or should I say, what's left of it?~
@48   = ~The warriors of this place must be useless dung heaps if they can not even defeat a pathetic band of fire giants.~
@49   = ~Hmmmm... I may be mistaken, but I think that sounds like it is more than just a pathetic band out there.~
@50   = ~I suppose if you had led their forces, they would have defeated them already.~
@51   = ~Saradush seems like it would be an interesting place to visit when not under siege.~
@52   = ~More carrion for the vultures!~ [shartw]
@53   = ~The bright side, we are certain to find a decent battle around here. Where there is war and death, there will be desperate men willing to do anything to save their meager lives.~
@54   = ~That goes without saying. I would have crushed their line after defeating their leader in single combat and placing his skull on the highest tower in the city.~
@55   = ~What makes you so confident that you could defeat them where so many others have failed?~
@56   = ~If you say so, Shar-Teel.~
@57   = ~Because Bhaalspawn, unlike you, I have no doubts as to what I want for my future. Shar has blessed me with the power to achieve it and that is exactly what I intend to do.~
@58   = ~Well, so long as I can count on your blade for the time being, I do not care what the future holds.~
@59   = ~Your arrogance will prove to be your undoing.~
@60   = ~Hahahaha! You sound so pathetic when you speak like that.~
@61   = ~Yes, but remember.. There can only be ONE!~
@62   = ~So Bhaalspawn, it would seem that your destiny has finally caught up with you, hasn't it?~
@63   = ~Tell me.. Do you intend on becoming the new Bhaal?~
@64   = ~I'd rather avoid that destiny if I could. Becoming a god is not what I desire. I just want to live a normal life.~
@65   = ~It is my destiny! <CHARNAME>, the new <PRO_LADYLORD> of Murder. Don't you like the sound of that?~
@66   = ~I don't know yet, Shar-Teel. Such an important event must be considered carefully.~
@67   = ~Well that is weak! I should have know that you would not have the courage to wield the power that has been given to you.~
@68   = ~Luckily, Shar has better judgement than to pick a coward when choosing her Nightbringers!~
@69   = ~Good!~
@70   = ~Once you become Bhaal, and I take on the essence of Shar, we will have a epic battle of the gods, right here on earth! There can only be one..~
@71   = ~Your indecision shows your weakness.~
@72   = ~Fetch me your waterskin, Garrick, I am thirsty.~
@73   = ~Yes sir!~ [garrickf]
@74   = ~I am at your service!~ [garrickg]
@75   = ~In you can't tell, I am being sarcastic. Sheesh! Can't you at least say please, Shar-Teel? I think you need to learn some manners!~ [garrick8]
@76   = ~Do be quiet, you miserable weakling! I cannot believe that you have managed to stay alive since Beregost.~
@77   = ~I thought that a usless male dung heap like you would surely be rotting in a ditch somewhere by now!~ [shart7]
@78   = ~Brave Sir Garrick is not destined to end up in a ditch by the side of the road! I have a most excellent path for me!~ [garrickp]
@79   = ~I shall be thought of gloriously.~ [garrick5]
@80   = ~Only if I keep you alive long enough for that to happen. If it was not for me, you would have died long ago!~ [shart1]
@81   = ~It's true.. that on occasion, you have saved my neck...~
@82   = ~That's why I have saved a special place for you in my newest ballad. Care to here a few dozen verses?~
@83   = ~I would rather be mauled to death by wild boars!~
@84   = ~Just because you have fooled <CHARNAME> into trusting you, Sarevok, that does mean that I do, you miserable male dung heap.~
@85   = ~Don't think I have forgotten how you turned my father against us.~
@86   = ~Angelo? He hardly needed convincing.~
@87   = ~A fleeting promise of power and glory were more than enough to sway him.~
@88   = ~It still was not enough to prevent your downfall, you swine!~
@89   = ~If I think for even a second that you are going to betray us, I will cut your throat and laugh while I watch you die!~
@90   = ~Hold your tongue, amazon, or I shall do it for you!~
@91   = ~Are you still there, amazon? Boo thought that perhaps the evil spirits had you taken over completely.~
@92   = ~The only way that I am leaving this world, you outland pig, is when a warrior of perfect skill defeats me. Until then, I shall be here, piling up the corpses like an avenging demon.~
@93   = ~Your sickness grows worse by the day.~
@94   = ~Be silent, you miserable jackal! I have not traveled the length of Faerun, challenging the swordmasters, to be pestered by the likes of you!~
@95   = ~Both Boo and I fear that the day when the evil Goddess, Shar, takes you over, we will have to inflict a righteous ass kicking upon you, amazon.~
@96   = ~Then draw your blade, you skulking rat! I'd be a fool to let you live!~
@97   = ~Now it not the time.~
@98   = ~Cowardly dog!~
@99   = ~Boo is not a dog! Nor is he a coward!~
@100  = ~So mageling, it would seem that you Bhaalspawn are more common than we had originally thought.~
@101  = ~Yes, it would appear that way.~
@102  = ~Let's see what they can do against a Nightbringer of Shar.~
@103  = ~I don't want to see. I have already seen too many things that I want to forget.~
@104  = ~When I left Candlekeep, I never imagined it would be like this. I never thought I could be the mortal half-god progeny of the dead god. I'm too carefree to be a Bhaalspawn.~
@105  = ~Stop your whining, mageling. Shar did not grant me her powers so that I could listen to you cry.~
@106  = ~It is only a matter of time before my blade will be wet with the blood of a Bhaalspawn... make sure it is not yours.~
@107  = ~Are you never going to learn, Shar-Teel? Living by the sword will only get you killed that way.~
@108  = ~Wrong mageling! People that live by the sword, kill and control those that do not. That is the true way of the world.~
@109  = ~The world, is what we make of it.~
@110  = ~Foolish thoughts from a foolish child! The sheltered life you led in Candlekeep has left you naive.~
@111  = ~And you tragic past has left you empty and hate filled.~
@112  = ~You know something, Avariel? You are not as pathetic as you once were.~
@113  = ~Ummm... Yes, thank you, Shar-Teel. I am feeling better.~
@114  = ~Perhaps traveling with a Bhaalspawn has hardened you a bit..~
@115  = ~I don't know about that. It still hurts to be reminded of my loss, but I...I think I have become used to it.~
@116  = ~I am pleased to see that you are growing stronger. I hate to see a woman feeling sorry for herself.~
@117  = ~*sniffle* As...as do I.~
@118  = ~Tell me silver spoon, why do you worship a decaying god, when Shar, the Lady of the Night, offers us women so much more the the hypocritical religions of men!~
@119  = ~*sigh* I don't want to get into this right now, Shar-Teel.~
@120  = ~Stop paying homage to gods that give you nothing in return, except to be the prize of a man's affection.~
@121  = ~Shar blesses all her daughters with powers~
@122  = ~Look, it sounds great, but I am just not that religious.~
@123  = ~You doubt the powers of the gods?~
@124  = ~No.. but I do doubt the honesty of those that serve them. How can I not when the bishops sit around in lavish temples drinking wine, while the poor, who pay tax to the church, starve?~
@125  = ~The Mistress of the Night cares not for coins to fill the coffers. All that she requires from her servants is loyalty and the courage to do her will.~
@126  = ~And that grants you access to the Shadow Weave?~
@127  = ~What do I care about magic, silver spoon?~
@128  = ~Well.. I thought it interesting and that you might know something more.~
@129  = ~All I know, silver spoon, it that I can defeat any man in battle now that I am a Nightbringer of Shar.~
@130  = ~Never mind.. I should have know you would have no knowledge of magical things.~
@131  = ~Bah! I never met the magic user that could withstand my steel blade ripping into their gut!~
@132  = ~Is everything okay, Shar-Teel?~
@133  = ~Of course! Why do you ask?~
@134  = ~It is just that I have noticed that you are limping. Do you need me to do a healing for you?~
@135  = ~Save your spells for some other weakling, Jaheira, I'm perfectly fine.~
@136  = ~I know you are the type that thinks taking a helping hand from another is a sign of weakness, but are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly?~
@137  = ~That is not you concern.~
@138  = ~You're wrong. As a healer, it is my primary duty to look after the welfare of the group.~
@139  = ~It's nothing! Will be better by the morning.~
@140  = ~And what if it does not heal properly? Could get infected.~
@141  = ~I thank you for your concern, but I don not think you should waste your spells on something as minor as this.~
@142  = ~If you are concerned about me using a spell, I could always create a salve for you from some herbs and flowers.~
@143  = ~If you insist, Jaheira!~
@144  = ~*sigh* I appreciate it!~
@145  = ~Think nothing of it.~
@146  = ~Tell me Viconia, have you become a member of the Order of the Dark Moon yet?~
@147  = ~You must tell me where you get your information, Shar-Teel, so that I can kill them for their lies.~
@148  = ~I have no idea what you are talking about.~
@149  = ~Hah, nice try, Viconia, but do really think that you could fool a Nightbringer of Shar?~
@150  = ~I feel the dark forces of the Shadow Weave around us every time I am in your presence.~
@151  = ~Shar does grant her drow followers special gifts.~
@152  = ~What makes the Drow so special?~
@153  = ~I would have thought it obvious. The Drow are superior to humans.~
@154  = ~Perhaps you should stop talking before you get yourself killed by an Nightbringer.~
@155  = ~No doubt, that would be wise.~
@156  = ~Tell me, Shar-Teel, what are your thoughts on the future? The distant future of course after all this is over.~
@157  = ~I will roam the land, challenging all the remaining Nightbringers until only one survives. Then I will usher in the new crisis where the avatars of Shar and Cyric will bring about an eternal darkness upon the world.~
@158  = ~You are beginning to sound like that gnome, Tiax.~
@159  = ~As for me, perhaps I would go back to Trademeet, pay my respects to Patrick and visit the Temple of Amaunator one last time.~
@160  = ~You really were attached to that useless male dung heap, weren't you?~
@161  = ~Oh Shar-teel! Such memories are painful to revisit without to mocking them!~
@162  = ~I do not understand why you foolish women insist on becoming so attached to a worthless man, that when he is gone, you lose some of yourself with him.~
@163  = ~You have to learn to be strong on your own, without a man, Mazzy.~
@164  = ~Oh, you would not understand.~
@165  = ~despite what you may think, I have known love before, but always found it to be nothing more than a weakness.~
@166  = ~Then that is your curse!~
@167  = ~I don't need love.. I need a sword that can cut steel and slice bone like butter!~
@168  = ~Huh? And here I thought that you were actually beginning to change your ways. I guess I was wrong.~
@169  = ~Don't be silly. The only thing that I value is being victorious in battle..~
@170  = ~You may come to regret that one day.~
@171  = ~Aye, ye may fight as well as any dwarven berserker, Shar-Teel, but ye stil drink ale like a sissy little girl with pig-tails!~
@172  = ~Just because I don't drink myself into a vomiting, slumbering mess like you do, dwarf, does not mean I cannot drink beer.~
@173  = ~Aye! Ye can drink it, okay.. from a wee sippy cup! Bwhahahaha!~
@174  = ~Listen well, Yeslick, for I will only tell you once! I will not be mocked by a haughty, religious peck like you.. Understand?~
@175  = ~Aye, just like I thought..~
@176  = ~Chicken!~
@177  = ~That's it! You have had it, dwarf!~
@178  = ~The next tavern that we go to, I'm going to drink you under the table.~
@179  = ~*burp* Loser pays the bill.~
@180  = ~As amazed that I am that <CHARNAME> has kept you around this long, I am even more amazed that you are still alive.~
@181  = ~Tell me shapeshifter.. what type of insect are you going to turn into during the next battle before scuttling off into a hole to hide?~
@182  = ~I was thinking of a stink beetle. That way, I will not be overpowered by all the stench of the horse dung you spread, Shar-Teel.~
@183  = ~Keep speaking to me like that, druid, and I'll make sure your head ends up stuffed, above the fireplace of the next tavern we stop at.~
@184  = ~You need to relax amazon, we are all on the same side.~
@185  = ~Here.. take a few of these mushrooms caps. They will help calm you down.~
@186  = ~Keep your blasted mushrooms!~
@187  = ~As you wish.~
@188  = ~Why don't you do something with that unsightly hair of yours, amazon? We want people to think that we are adventurers, not that I am pimping some cheap harlot!~
@189  = ~Watch what you say to me, you cowardly Zhentarim jackal, or I will end your life where you stand!~ [sharty]
@190  = ~Yes, yes.. You have been saying as much since Baldur's Gate, and yet I am still here.~
@191  = ~Perphaps it's because for the time being, you are of better use as cover for goblin arrows than fertilizer.~
@192  = ~Hrrm..~
@193  = ~(She is extremely bitchy! But she is also very good with a blade. I must endure her for just a short time longer.)~
@194  = ~And besides.. what does a bald man that spend his time braiding jewlery into his beard, know about a woman's hair?~
@195  = ~I am not bald!~
@196  = ~Say Shar-teel, did I ever mention that my cousin, Janella, was an amazon?~
@197  = ~Tough as nails that one, with fists as big as a grapefruit.~
@198  = ~I find that hard to believe.~
@199  = ~It's true! Although where she is from, the call themselves not amazons, but pygmies.~
@200  = ~They are deadly with those blowpipes and poison darts. Would stop your heart in less than ten minutes if not treated.~
@201  = ~Firing darts at someone from behind cover and then running away is the eptimoe of cowardice.~
@202  = ~If you were half your size, you might rethink that. Besides, they also used these axes made of obsidian, and daggers made from bone.~
@203  = ~Heh! Sounds like nothing but a bunch of farmers with pointy sticks.~
@204  = ~Enough with your stories, Jansen! Fetch me a yer wineskin.~
@205  = ~Why do you never speak, ranger? Most of the men that I have known cannot hear enough of themselves. You are different in that respect.~
@206  = ~I would much rather listen to the sounds of the world. Why do you ask?~
@207  = ~Should you not be threatening to tickle my innards with your sword? I am after all, a man.~
@208  = ~At times, I enjoy listening to the banterings of the weaker sex. It can be rather amusing.~
@209  = ~I'm pleased you approve.~
@210  = ~I especially like to hear the warriors talk about how dangerous they are, right before I thrust my sword in their necks. Ha! You men are pathetic!~ [shartf]
@211  = ~We could always address the issue, should you wish. A challenge perhaps.. battle of the sexes? We could settle this amongst ourselves.~
@212  = ~Loser has to carry the winners gear around for the next week.~
@213  = ~I would love to teach you a few lessons, ranger. You are on!~
@214  = ~Tell me, Lady Nighthawk.. Who do you wish to play the part of you in the stage performance of 'The Throne of Bhaal'?~
@215  = ~It's the newest sensation to hit the playhouse at the Five Flagons since the tap dancing dragon from Vushta.~
@216  = ~I care not, so long as it is not some ditzy blonde with enormous breasts.~
@217  = ~You'd prefer a brunette then?~
@218  = ~I'd PREFER.. that you stay out of my face and desist from asking such stupid questions.~
@219  = ~Mmmmm.... Perhaps a redhead. Yes! For the fiery temperament.~
@220  = ~I must admit, Korgan, you are not as useless as some of your other dwarven kin. Oh, how I enjoyed hearing their death cries as I hacked them to pieces in the Arena!~ [sharth]
@221  = ~You will find that this dwarf is not as easy to kill, amazon.~
@222  = ~Anyhow, dem half starved hill dwarf, slaves that ye are fighting in the battle pits are hardly the measure of a true dwarf's fighting prowess.~
@223  = ~I have fought more worthy opponents than some pathetic dwarves.~
@224  = ~Oh really? Like what?~
@225  = ~I once shot a cyclops in its eye with my bow and arrow, dispatched five Uruk-hai berserker orcs with a shield and spear before slaying a seven headed hydra with a flame sword.~
@226  = ~Ya spin stories like a gnome, amazon.~
@227  = ~I am a Nightbringer of Shar, foolish dwarf.. Why would I need to lie about such things?~
@228  = ~The fact remains that I killed far worse things when I first traveled with <CHARNAME> in Baldur's Gate.. And that you would not a minute in the battle pits.~
@229  = ~Nay, wench! I have survived the Underdark, where the horrors ya face around every corner are far worse than anything they can cage and unleash at the Copper Coronet.~
@230  = ~We shall see.~
@231  = ~I feel that I have accomplished much by gaining my knighthood, but that I can be doing so much more twer I a paladin.~
@232  = ~And just what would you do, oh mighty 'Sir' Anomen, if you were a paladin?~
@233  = ~I would use the god given powers bestowed upon a paladin, to fight alongside <CHARNAME> and rid Athkatla of all the followers of evil.~
@234  = ~Do not think I do not sense your condescending remarks. I just happen to ignore them, because I know they come from jealousy.~
@235  = ~Oh please! Shar has given me more power than you could ever hope to achieve from worshipping your false god.~
@236  = ~Deals with the Lady of Loss or not to be taken lightly, amazon. All her followers pay a terrible price for the cursed blessings she places upon them.~
@237  = ~You know nothing of the gods, you useless male dung heap!~ [shart7]
@238  = ~Tell me, old man, do you actually think that during your time in the Order, that you have made any change in Athkatla?~
@239  = ~In the Order, we always try to bring justice where there is tyranny.. and under my watch I can say that the streets are safer than they have ever been.~
@240  = ~That is because your kind hardly ever leave the comforts of the Temple and Government Districts. One only has to look as the Slums and the Docks to see that crime is still rampant.~
@241  = ~As much as try to set an example for our fellow bothers and sisters to follow, we're only human. Cities will always have inequality.. and where inequality exists, jealousy and hatred will breed.~
@242  = ~So why fight that which is inevitable?~
@243  = ~Evil will always exist.. we seek to preserve the balance.. guardians to protect the world when it is on the brink of darkness.~
@244  = ~A fool's errand.~
@245  = ~Would you ever consider becoming a Silver Dragon, Shar-Teel? We would be happy to have the services of a mighty warrior woman like you.~
@246  = ~Please! Why would a champion gladiator like me, want to work with a pack of spineless merchants in tight pants, led by a coin-pinching, silver spoon like you?~
@247  = ~Well, that wasn't very nice!~
@248  = ~Look, girl! I have no time to join you on your foolish quest for gold and riches.. The only thing that matters to me is being the last one.~
@249  = ~The last one? Shar-Teel, what are you talking about?~
@250  = ~The last Nightbringer with her head still on her shoulders.~
@251  = ~You are staring to scare me!~
@252  = ~Hahaha! Don't be frightened, silver spoon! As it is written in the Scrolls of Shar, so shall it be!~
@253  = ~Do my eyes deceive me, or were you looking upon my god-like body, Shar-Teel?~
@254  = ~Just looking for a good place to stick a dagger, you scum!~ [sharty]
@255  = ~Hahahaha! I love a woman with some fight in her.. You are so unlike the noble woman that I have masterfully seduced. Perhaps that's why you have always fascinated me.~ [eldot12]
@256  = ~I'm charmed!~ [shart6]
@257  = ~Indeed! I thought perhaps the feeling was mutual.. It always is with me.~ [eldot26]
@258  = ~Why don't we consummate this new agreement between us?~ [eldot32]
@259  = ~If you even so much as lay a finger on me, I'll cut off that miserable little peck of yours and stick it down your throat!~ [shart9]
@260  = ~As you command...~ [eldot20]
@261  = ~I must give you credit, amazon. You seem to show more courage in battle than your father.~
@262  = ~Perhaps I chose the wrong Dosan to serve me.~
@263  = ~I would have never served a wretched swine like you, Sarevok.~
@264  = ~Your father felt the same way at one time.. but then he served me until meeting his death in the Undercity.~
@265  = ~I am not my father.~
@266  = ~Yes, I can can see that. You are better with a sword than he was.~
@267  = ~He was the one that first taught me to fight.~
@268  = ~Until you defeated him.. and then you became the master.~
@269  = ~With you on my side, we would have certainly defeated, <CHARNAME>, and it would be I that ascended into divinity.~
@270  = ~Useless male dung heap! Do no lose yourself in these dreams of grandeur.~ [shart7]
@271  = ~You don't really think that the bitch goddess, Shar, can withstand the powers of the Lord of Murder?~
@272  = ~There are none that can!~
@273  = ~You useless male dung heap! Shar grants me with powers that are beyond anything that you scumwad Bhaalspawns could even dream of.~ [shart7]
@274  = ~The passion that your quest for vengeance instills in you is inspiring.. if misplaced.~
@275  = ~Vengeance?~
@276  = ~Vengeance for your dead mother... The one you blame your father for failing to protect.~
@277  = ~If you speak of my mother again, I will end your life where you stand!~ [sharty]
@278  = ~As scarce a thing as truth is, the supply has always been in excess of the demand.~
@279  = ~You are stronger than I thought, ranger. Carrying my gear has hardly slowed you down at all.~
@280  = ~I'm glad. Now I don't have to spend my gold buying a pack mule.~
@281  = ~I still think that you cheated.~
@282  = ~Protect yourself at all times! Even a miserable black dog like you should know that.~
@283  = ~Yes, but I thought we were testing our steel. How does a kick to the groin figure?~
@284  = ~The challenge was to see who was the better warrior.. as if that was ever in dispute..~
@285  = ~Dirty tactic!~
@286  = ~Ha! Have fun carrying my equipment for another week, ranger!~
@287  = ~Do you remember the first time we met, Jaheira?~
@288  = ~Yes... It was in Mutamin's Garden, right before <CHARNAME> employed, Korax the Ghoul, to kill the Basilisks.~
@289  = ~I don't know why <PRO_HESHE> ever dealt with that worm ridden scum anyhow. I could have defeated those Basilisks on my own.~
@290  = ~Since he was immune to the Basilisks' gaze, it seemed wise to use him as a buffer so the rest of could pelt them with arrows from afar.~
@291  = ~It might have been wise, had the ghoul not turned on us afterwards.~
@292  = ~Had it not been for my swift move that cleaved its head from its body, no doubt more than one of us would have fell victim to that filthy creature.~
@293  = ~It is the risk that one takes when dealing with the undead.~
@294  = ~Why bring it up now though, Shar-Teel?~
@295  = ~It just occured to me how long ago it seems that was..~
@296  = ~We have been busy.~
@297  = ~So many fools have met their death at the end of my blade since that time, that I scarcely remember their faces, let alone their names.~
@298  = ~Do you remember, Kirian, the leader of that party of adventurers that hailed us not long after you dispatched of Korax?~
@299  = ~That spitlick? He did not mock us any longer, after I cut off his legs.~
@300  = ~That may have been a while ago, but you haven't changed.~
@301  = ~What will you do once we have fulfilled Alaundo’s prophecy about the Bhaalspawn, Shar-Teel?~
@302  = ~Will you go back to Athkatla to fight in the battle pits again?~
@303  = ~No, I have wasted enough time slaying mindless beasts and worthless gladiators.~
@304  = ~After my time with <CHARNAME> is at an end, I will seek out all the remaining Nightbringers in Faerun and defeat them one bye one, until I am the only one left.~
@305  = ~You wish to become the Avatar of Shar?~
@306  = ~Together with the Avatar of Cyric, I will bring about the downfall of Mystra and the Weave.~
@307  = ~You would destroy the very essence of all magic in Faerun?~
@308  = ~It will be great watching the powerless nations of the earth that were ruled by wizards, topple under the shields and pikes of my armies.~
@309  = ~This is madness! The spirit that Shar has placed inside of you is taking over the very essence of your soul, amazon. I want no part of what you are speaking of..~
@310  = ~Ha! I should have known that a weakling magic user would not have the spine to hear the truth. Nothing can stop the prophecy!~
@311  = ~Do not trouble yourself though, for followers of Shar will still have their magic powers, as the Shadow Weave will be left untouched.~
@312  = ~How can you be so sure? The Dark Moon heresy teaches that Selûne and Shar are two aspects of the same deity.. That even though they are opposed, that one cannot exist without the other.~
@313  = ~I fear that without the Weave of Mystra, the Shadow Weave could not be controlled and would collapse as well.~
@314  = ~Your fears are meaningless, drow! The Mistress of the Night has powers beyond your comprehension! She will make sure that the powers of darkness remain.~
@315  = ~Tell me, tiefling, who taught you your sword technique?~
@316  = ~Impressed with the way that Chaos and Entropy glide through the air, are we, Lady Nighthawk?~
@317  = ~No.. I just thought you would want them dead for cheating you.~
@318  = ~Very amusing..~
@319  = ~Fetch me some grapes, Garrick, I am hungry!~
@320  = ~*sigh* Not this again!~ [garrickj]
@321  = ~I won't be able to protect you properly on an empty stomach. Hurry, fetch me something!~
@322  = ~Fetch me a kiss!~
@323  = ~I'll fetch you a cracked skull if you get wise with me!~
@324  = ~Sheesh! Well that's gratitude for you!~
@325  = ~I have prayed to Tempus.. That he watch over us during these difficult times.~
@326  = ~Save your prayers, Branwen. As the future Lord of Murder, I have all the protection that I need.~
@327  = ~Thank you, Branwen. We could use any type of blessing that we can get.~
@328  = ~You sound like such a bimbo when you talk like that.~
@329  = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, Do not start acting like a Loki spawn I left behind.~
@330  = ~A god's favor is fickle, at best, but to die in battle is the most glorious death of all.~
@331  = ~We have fought bravely up until now, and Tempus willing, perhaps I will fight at your side again until this is all over. But even if that is not what destiny has in store for me, I must tell you that ever sice I left Seawolf, I have always dreamt of being part of such a worthy band as this.~
@332  = ~I am glad to be part of your war party. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for giving me that chance.~
@333  = ~Don't mention it. You have proved your worth many times over.~
@334  = ~Come, let us move onward.~
@335  = ~Do not mock me! I do not take such insults lightly.~
@336  = ~So it would seem that the young girl from Candlekeep is much more than the mere thief that we once knew her as.~
@337  = ~Trust me, Branwen, I never, in my wildest dreams, ever thought I could be a Bhaalspawn.~
@338  = ~I guess after living as a circus attraction at the Nashkel Carnival and then traveling with you and <CHARNAME> for as long as I have, nothing should surprise me any more.~
@339  = ~Well, I hope you are ready for more, because this thing is not over yet and there could still be a few surprises in store.~
@340  = ~May Tempus watch over us during these tumultuous times.~
@341  = ~Branwen, Branwen.. more beautiful than a canyon!~
@342  = ~That is not a very flattering comparison.~
@343  = ~She had golden hair and the most beautiful lips..~ [garrickn]
@344  = ~And cast a spell with a shake from her hips!~ [garricks]
@345  = ~What have you been smoking? Where do you come up with this stuff?~
@346  = ~I did have a pipeload of green skunk earlier... but is neither here, nor there!~
@347  = ~When I am around a woman a beautiful as you, that is all the inspiration that I need!~ [garricko]
@348  = ~Wow, Garrick! You really know how to make a girl feel special. *rolls eyes*~
@349  = ~Ahhhh.. This is true, this is true..~ [garrickt]
@350  = ~Ye look like ye could use a drink, Branwen. Here, take a swig of this.~
@351  = ~UGH! What is that Yeslick? It has a burn, to it..~
@352  = ~Hehehehe! Tell me lass, have ye ever tried, the honey liquor that we call, mead?~
@353  = ~No, I can't say that I have.~
@354  = ~Aye! Well ye have now. It's a little somethin' that the dwarves of Mirabar drink after a hard day of mining.~
@355  = ~It has a little bit of punch ta it, but its stout drink fer dwarves that will put hair on yer chest!~
@356  = ~*hiccup* Let me have another drink of that!~
@357  = ~Aye!~
@358  = ~Mmmm.. That's good! It's really not going to put hair on my chest though, is it? *hiccup*~
@359  = ~Nay! That is just what we dwarves say when a drink is mighty strong.~
@360  = ~Take 'er easy though, Branwen. That's got ta last me until we get ta the next tavern, which won't be soon enough fer me!~
@361  = ~Branwen, me and you really need to go shopping for some new clothes for you. You need a few casual garments to wear, for when you are not wearing battle armor.~ [skien]
@362  = ~I hardly think that such things are of importance at the moment.~
@363  = ~Looking good is always important! You never know when you might miss the chance to make a good first impression.. and you know what they say about those?~
@364  = ~That you only get one..?~
@365  = ~Correct! That's why when we get the chance we have to visit the garment district and pick you out something nice for the new season.~
@366  = ~Tempus, give me strength!~
@367  = ~Oh come on! This is going to be fun!~
@368  = ~You know Branwen, I have this terrible pain in the neck that I cannot get rid of. I was hoing that you might be able to using those magical healing hands of yours to give me a massage when you have the chance.~
@369  = ~Here, I'll just cast a spell..~
@370  = ~No! I think this kind of pain requires the special attention that only you hands can provide.~
@371  = ~Don't get fresh with me, Eldoth, I'm not one of those tavern harlots that will fall over at your every word.~
@372  = ~I know.. That is why I fancy you so much, I suppose.~
@373  = ~You make me sick! I could never be with a conniving thief like you!~
@374  = ~Your words stab me like a dagger..~
@375  = ~And so the villain that planned to use the Iron Throne as his pawn to drive Baldur’s Gate and Amn into war in now in our service.~
@376  = ~By Tempus' Shield! I never thought that such a twist of events was possible.~
@377  = ~What you think is possible, is irrelevant, Northwoman. I have grasped power beyond your ability to comprehend.~
@378  = ~It was that greed for power that led to your eveuntual downfall Sarevok.~
@379  = ~No it wasn't. It was, <CHARNAME>.~
@380  = ~Whatever the case, you still have not suffered enough for all the lives that you ruined.~
@381  = ~Perhaps you are right, but that is not for you to decide.~
@382  = ~Tempus sees all. Mark my words, Sarevok, you will be judged.~
@383  = ~None of us can escape our past.~
@384  = ~Speaking of which, how is your old friend, Tranzig? Now there was a wizard that could leave you looking stone faced with his vast knowledge of magic.~
@385  = ~May Auril bestow a frost kiss upon you for mocking me, fiend.~
@386  = ~Tell me, Jaheira, have you tried the honey liquor? It gives you a halo.~
@387  = ~Branwen! I thought that excessive drinking was forbidden amongst Clerics of Tempus.~
@388  = ~Yes, that is true.. but do not forget that I am also Northwoman. During the really cold winters in Seawolf, we would drink mead just to keep warm.~
@389  = ~Seems like an unforgiving place.~
@390  = ~It was.. although, the harsh winters honed the survival instinct that is neccesary for any warrior.~
@391  = ~The islands also had many beautiful things as well.. Things that I have never seen elsewhere.~
@392  = ~And if you had been accepted as a priest, you would have never left those shores.~
@393  = ~The strange thing is how my feelings about it have changed over the years. For some time afterwards, I was resentful..~
@394  = ~But had it not been for that denial, I would have never ended up as circus attraction at the Nashkel Carnival, and would never had met you or <CHARNAME>.~
@395  = ~So perhaps it was for the best.~
@396  = ~Tell me Branwen, do you think that the gods lay out our destinies for us, or do we have control over our own lives?~
@397  = ~I can't say for sure. I know Tempus watches over us, but does he plan of futures, who can say? Why don't we discuss it some time, over a few cups of honey liquor?~
@398  = ~That sounds like a good idea.~
@399  = ~Here Aerie, take a drink of this.~
@400  = ~Th-thank you very much, Branwen.. I am quite thirsty.~
@401  = ~UGH!~
@402  = ~This is not water!~
@403  = ~No, it's honey liquor. Some of the beekeepers that worked for the temples back in Athkatla were kind enough to gift me a bottle.~
@404  = ~Mmm... A bit too strong for my taste, I' afraid.~
@405  = ~Don't say such things! You just need to get used to it is all.~
@406  = ~I th-think I would be sick if I had even another sip.~
@407  = ~From the look on your face, I don't doubt it.~
@408  = ~Since when do you drink liquor anyhow?~
@409  = ~Even we devout Clerics of Tempus must have ways to enjoy the fruits of our labors.~
@410  = ~Just keep it between us. Not because I worried about my reputation, mind you, it is just that I have only a small amount left.~
@411  = ~Back in the Seawolf, we used to say that a good day was one where the rain did not soak your feet.~
@412  = ~I must have been wonderful. I hope one day to visit the Norheim Isles before my time on this world is done.~
@413  = ~They are beautiful.. and I have no doubt that If Tempus wills it, you will one day travel there and love them as much as I do.~
@414  = ~Indeed. It would be a nice change from all the death that I have witnessed since traveling with <CHARNAME>.~
@415  = ~There is no need to despair, Cernd. We have always fought bravely and with honor. The Lord of Battles will grant us his favor for our righteous actions in war.~
@416  = ~Even if, as you claim, my soul is not in jeopardy, it is still stained for an eternity.~
@417  = ~How long have you trained yourself in the arts of war, Anomen?~
@418  = ~Quite a few years, Lady Branwen. Twas necessary to become part of the Order of the Radiant Heart.~
@419  = ~You sacrifice a great deal for the Order. It must mean a great deal to you.~
@420  = ~Aye, almost as much as your faith in Tempus.~
@421  = ~I'm glad that Helm has gifted you such dedication, Anomen...~
@422  = ~Why thank you, Lady Branwen.~
@423  = ~How about yourself, m'lady? How long have you been practicing the warrior arts?~
@424  = ~In Seawolf, all people are trained from childhood.. some no older than seven years of age.~
@425  = ~Twould be different from anything I have have ever known. In Atkatla, only women of high ranking noble families are usually allowed to become warriors, although exceptions have been made..~
@426  = ~I have seen much during my travels, and yet I tell you, some things never change.~
@427  = ~Never in all my life did I think I would travel as far as we have. The Norheim Isles seem like a distant memory from the dreams of a past life.~
@428  = ~How about you, Shar-Teel? Did you ever think that you would see such wonders?~
@429  = ~I have traveled long and far is search of the weapons masters, so that they could teach me the riddle of steel.~
@430  = ~You do seem to have more spine that a lot of the men in this party.~
@431  = ~What is the riddle of steel?~
@432  = ~One cannot be told what the riddle is. One must experience it, first hand. Only then can you truly understand.~
@433  = ~Perhaps one day I shall, if Tempus wills it.~
@434  = ~Knowing the Riddle of Steel does not come without much personal sacrifice. I would not wish such hardship upon you.~
@435  = ~In any case, I am proud to stand among such a strong warrior woman as you.~
@436  = ~It has always been an honor to fight by your side.~
@437  = ~Damn it Northwoman! Can't you even cast a healing spell correctly? GAH! You were more useful when you were a statue.~
@438  = ~What is it now, Edwin?~
@439  = ~My knee still hurts! UGH! Your primitive magic is absolutely worthless!!~
@440  = ~My spell cured the flesh wound.. Perhaps it is just your old bones that ache? Tempus bestows upon me, great powers, but even still, I am unable to heal everything.~
@441  = ~For example.. I am unable to rid myself of this pain in my neck whenever you are around, wizard.~
@442  = ~Your wit never ceases to amuse me, barbarian.~
@443  = ~(GAH! Damn that hurts!)~
@444  = ~Tell me my blue bird, do you miss the artic winds of your homeland flowing freely in your hair?~
@445  = ~Not a day goes by that I long to see the misty mountains around Seawolf.. But Tempus has a plan for us all, and I believe that by traveling with <CHARNAME>, I am doing more good in the name of the Lord of Battles than I ever could if I had stayed in the Norheim Isles.~
@446  = ~I would very much like to visit Norheim one day.. especially if all the birds there are as tall, blonde and beautiful as you are.~
@447  = ~Hahahaha! You would love it there.. so long as you could handle the cold winters.~
@448  = ~Brrrrr.. *shudder*! To be honest, I'm not sure that I could.. ~
@449  = ~Don't tell me that you are afraid of a little cold?~
@450  = ~It is not my favorite choice of climate, but I would sacrifice if it meant the chance of meeting a lovely song bird from the North.~
@451  = ~And if the women are as beautiful as I think, I'm sure I can think of a few ways to keep myself warm during the winters.~
@452  = ~Branwen, you traveled with <CHARNAME> back in Baldur's Gate... Tell me, have you always known of <PRO_HISHER> divinity?~
@453  = ~Although I suspected that <PRO_HESHE> was a special person, no... We knew nothing of <PRO_HISHER> divinity.~
@454  = ~It was only later that we learned about <PRO_HISHER> heritage.~
@455  = ~What a revelation it must have been, to learn that you are the child of a god.~
@456  = ~Even more so when <PRO_HESHE> learned that Sarevok was <PRO_HISHER> half brother.~
@457  = ~It is hard for me to believe that <CHARNAME> could come from the same line as that murderer.~
@458  = ~Sometimes, I barely believe it either.~
@459  = ~Minsc and Boo cannot believe it either!~
@460  = ~And now we are in debt to that villain for giving us the knowledge of how to open the magical portal to the first of the challenges.~
@461  = ~Tempus works in mysterious ways. I am sure that Sarevok is part of his plan, and that all shall reveal itself when the time is right.~
@462  = ~By Torm, I hope you are right.~
@463  = ~It must have been amazing to travel with <CHARNAME> during the Iron Crisis. The stories of your adventures reached us even in Amn.~
@464  = ~I consider it an honor to have fought alongside <PRO_HIMHER> during those times. Never in my life had I ever felt I have better served Tempus.~
@465  = ~I just hope that one day, for my sake and the sake of my fallen companions, that when people remember the tale of <CHARNAME>, that their is some mention in there somewhere of Mazzy Fentan, halfling paladin of Arvoreen!~
@466  = ~Do not worry, Mazzy.. You are a strong warrior with a heart full of courage. Tempus always reserves a place in the Hall of Heroes for such people.~
@467  = ~Thank you for those kind words, Branwen.~
@468  = ~Have you ever traveled outside of Amn?~
@469  = ~I never traveled as far as the Norheims, but when I was younger, back when my father was still alive, he used to take us everywhere with him. From the Dalelands, the Kingdom of Cormyr, to the nation of Sembia.. I visited them all.~
@470  = ~Will you return to Amn once our travels with <CHARNAME> have come to an end?~
@471  = ~To be honest, our adventures have kept my mind so busy, I hadn't given it much thought.. Although, I suppose I do have some unfinished business to take care of back home.~
@472  = ~What about you? Where will you go?~
@473  = ~I'm afraid that once my services here are done, I might have to return to Athkatla to teach tutorial once more.. That is unless Tempus finds some other worthy cause for me.~
@474  = ~That is no life for an adventurer.. being trapped in the library all day.~
@475  = ~Tempus requires that we all serve. Sometimes that means we must sacrifice for the greater good.~
@476  = ~Maybe.. But I hope a better fate befall you. Your talents would be wasted there.~
@477  = ~If Tempus will it.~
@478  = ~Korgan, though you are an uncivilized brute, I have come to admire your skill in battle.~
@479  = ~Aye! And I have come ta respect yer supple backside, lass.~
@480  = ~Tempus could guide your wayward soul, if you let him.~
@481  = ~HA! I dunna need a blessin' from yer barbarian god, Northwoman, all I need is ta keep me axe Sharp!~
@482  = ~You know, in a war of virtues, thou art truly unarmed.~
@483  = ~Hahahaha! Ya know what ye can do with yer virtues?~
@484  = ~Take 'em, and stick 'em up that nice looking arse of yers.~
@485  = ~May Tempus someday show you the error of your ways.~
@486  = ~Branwen, do you think that when this is all over, that we will be able to return to our normal lives.~
@487  = ~I'm not so sure that there is such a thing as a, 'normal' life, anymore.~
@488  = ~Interesting.. I suppose `you are right though.. Now that father has passed, life will be anything but normal.~
@489  = ~I have been wondering what life will be like once this is all over though. Will the routine of running a castle keep me as enthralled as traveling with <CHARNAME>?~
@490  = ~Doubtful.. though I find it hard to think of anything that could match the level of excitement that I have felt traveling with Faerun <CHARNAME>.~
@491  = ~Have you given any thought as to what you are going to do? Still intent on traveling back to Athkatla?~
@492  = ~To be honest, I'm not sure.. But I am confident that when Tempus is ready a path shall be layed out before me.~
@493  = ~Well, if you wanted, I could always use a captain of the guard at my castle. I have seen what you can do and I would be honored if you accepted.~
@494  = ~You would have a woman as a captain of your guard?~
@495  = ~I don't see why a woman could not do a good a job as a man. Give the matter some thought before you answer.. I want you to be sure.~
@496  = ~Do not wish to have someone, Shar-Teel.. someone to hold you in the night?~
@497  = ~I have given up on such foolish dreams long ago.~
@498  = ~It is a pity that the resentment you feel for your father is keeping you from knowing the pleasures of love.~
@499  = ~I have experienced the pleasures of the flesh. I know what it is that all men desire and have learned that my time is better spent otherwise.~
@500  = ~Love is more than just carnal pursuits.. and it doesn't always have to be between a man and a woman.~
@501  = ~What are you implying?~
@502  = ~Nothing.. just that for a strong warrior woman like you, it must be difficult to hold it all in.. the battles, the near-deaths.. Keeping that all tucked inside, without anyone to confide in.~
@503  = ~I have learned to cope.~
@504  = ~You musn't be so cold, Shar-Teel.. You must learn to trust others.~
@505  = ~The only thing that I trust in, is my blade.~
@506  = ~Shar-Teel, will you ever let go of your self destructive worship of Shar? You are too valiant a warrior for your soul to be lost in the abyss.~
@507  = ~During our travels together, I learned to respect your skill in battle and valued our friendship, Branwen, but please, do not try your preachy, conversion banter on me. I have no time for it.~
@508  = ~That friendship that you speak of, which has blossomed like a spring flower, is the reason that I urge you to change your way.~
@509  = ~I don't want to see you fade away to nothing. Grab unto Tempus' Shield! Save yourself from eternal damnation.~
@510  = ~Do you know how silly you sound right now?~
@511  = ~I'm sorry, I'm only try to look out for a friend.~
@512  = ~I appreciate that..~
@513  = ~Are you sure about this?~
@514  = ~Of course!~
@515  = ~It is just..~
@516  = ~I have never done this before.~
@517  = ~Don't worry, I've done it a thousand times.~
@518  = ~Okay.. I trust you Branwen.~
@519  = ~Good.~
@520  = ~Hahaha...~
@521  = ~You know, I have never met anyone as nervous as you are about waxing their legs.~
@522  = ~I have always used a pumice stone or Shark teeth before.~
@523  = ~Trust me, this works better.~
@524  = ~Making a change in the ranks? I thought we would see things through to the end.~
@525  = ~We will. Stay with me. ~
@526  = ~Wait here, I will return.~
@527  = ~Return to the pocket plane until I call for you again.~
@528  = ~A triumphant day, indeed! I welcome your company once again!~
@529  = ~Sorry to keep you waiting around like a statue, Branwen, but I don't have need for you right now.~
@530  = ~Grab your things, Branwen, it's time to go.~
@531  = ~Such a dry and arid place.. So different from the beautiful snowy peaks of that you can see from all around you in Seawolf.~
@532  = ~Let us take care of our business here quickly, <CHARNAME>, so that we can head back to cooler climates..~
@533  = ~Such a sad tale.~
@534  = ~It seems that whichever city you go to now, you will find feeble minded fools like this that allow themselves to be enslaved by a cult!~
@535  = ~Honors demands that we help these people, <CHARNAME>.~
@536  = ~We must do something about this injustice!~
@537  = ~These people are made to suffer as Gromnir sits at banquet! This is not right!~
@538  = ~By Tempus' shield! We must defend these people from this tyrant!~
@539  = ~Truly these people find themselves in an unenviable position.~
@540  = ~Trapped inside the city by an invading army and terrorized by the people that should protect them.~
@541  = ~By Tempus' shield! From here, it look as if this battle is already lost.~
@542  = ~Something must be done about this, Gromnir.~
@543  = ~A god's favor is fickle, at best. It seems like we have been brought into the midst of a battle!~
@544  = ~It was unfortunate that he had to meet his death, but perhaps the people of the city will rest easier without that tyrant controlling over them.~
@545  = ~Tempus is a god that best watches over those that watch over themselves.~
@546  = ~Honor demands that we help this man.~
@547  = ~Think nothing of it. Tempus looks favorably upon those that battle for a righteous cause.~
@548  = ~I wans't going to say anything, because I thought it would be rude, but the prices are extremely high for such a fly ridden town in the middle of a desolate wasteland.~ [skien]
@549  = ~Must be a real rent saver.~
@550  = ~Come on <CHARNAME> *cough* *cough*. This place may be dusty, but I'm sure we can find SOMETHING of worth in here.~ [skien]
@551  = ~I love a happy ending.~
@552  = ~Ooohh! A black market! Come on, <CHARNAME>, let's see if we can't find some splendiferous items that we must have.~ [skien]
@553  = ~Spend gold like water, huh? Sound like the kind of people that I want buying from me.~ [skien]
@554  = ~Valuable idol you say...?~ [skien]
@555  = ~Well this is another fine mess you have gotten us in!~
@556  = ~Well that's good. You should do what your mother tells you.~
@557  = ~It looks as if you have not lost your touch with people.~
@558  = ~Oi! I think I going to be sick!~
@559  = ~Oh great! We just got here and already people are trying to kill us.~
@560  = ~Why can't we ever teleport into a castle with room service?~
@561  = ~I agree with Imoen. Let's keep looking, we are bound to uncover something.~
@562  = ~Please! As if a Silvershield would ever be caught somewhere that allowed stolen goods!~
@563  = ~Ugh! Well that was brilliant! I hope you have another plan for us to get through this.~
@564  = ~Wait.. You don't want me any more? I thought I was doing pretty well, myself. What gives?~
@565  = ~True. Let's not split up just yet.~
@566  = ~Good. It's better that we stay together.~
@567  = ~Oh, fine. I'll do just what you say.~
@568  = ~Missing me yet? Let's get going then.~
@569  = ~You'd better soon. This is really starting to annoy me.~
@570  = ~Good. You shouldn't leave me behind, you know. It's better if we're together.~
@571  = ~I dunna understand what ye are thinkin' sometimes. Don't think that ye be better served by keeping my hammer at yer side?~
@572  = ~A wise move. Together we can't possibly fail.~
@573  = ~I'd sooner be back in my cell if you merely wish me to sit about with no purpose.~
@574  = ~Fine, I'll be leaving the likes of you. Bust some heads, will you?~
@575  = ~So you've come back, have you?  Perhaps we should join forces once again.  There is much work left to be done.~
@576  = ~*cough* *cough* This place has ta be one of the dustiest pile of camel dung that I have ever had the misfortune of visiting!~ [yeslickr]
@577  = ~Watcher's Keep.. supposedly built by the Gods themselves.~
@578  = ~Hmm.. Not as nice as it would be if it had been built by dwarves, but I guess it has some fine features.~
@579  = ~Lesser creature? By Clangeddin's Silverbeard, nobody calls a dwarf a lesser creature!~ [yeslick9]
@580  = ~Be Silent, FOOL!~
@581  = ~Tell me ya have some cold drinks here. This damn desert heat has got me parched!~ [yeslickr]
@582  = ~Your ego is positively elven!~ [yeslickn]
@583  = ~Aye! It looks like that sarsaparilla has gone straight ta yer head.~ [yeslicks]
@584  = ~Twould be good if we tithed a few coins ta these poor souls. The favor of gods is worth a few gold..~ [yeslick4]
@585  = ~Aye! I could use a stout dwarven ale if ye have it.~ [yeslick1]
@586  = ~Hopefully ye have something stronger than than wimpy elven wine.~
@587  = ~Our selection is limited because of the siege, but I am sure we have something to quench your thirst.~
@588  = ~Thank Moradin, because I have the thirst of a thousand dwarves.~ [yeslick3]
@589  = ~Leave dem dwarves alone, lad.~ [Yeslick_]
@590  = ~Sad that it had to end like it did.~ [Yeslickw]
@591  = ~Aye! Dem elves do have an arrogant way about them.~ [yeslickn]
@592  = ~No need ta cast us away like lepers. Afterall, all dwarves are kin.~ [yeslick_]
@593  = ~I has been a long time since I met a dwarf who was a stranger.~
@594  = ~Tell me.. from where do you hail?~
@595  = ~I am Yeslick of the dwarven clan Orothiar from the Cloak Wood mines.~ [yeslickh]
@596  = ~Well met.~
@597  = ~You are a long way from home, Orothiar.~
@598  = ~Aye, my travels with <CHARNAME>, have taken me far and wide.~
@599  = ~May Clangeddin's Silverbeard watch over you like a blanket of security, my friend. These are dangerous times.~
@600  = ~Thank fer yer kindness~ [yeslicky]
@601  = ~Aye.. As fer the rest of you..~
@602  = ~Nay! If ye bury an elf, ya'll have nothin' but wild flowers growing everywhere for months!~ [yeslickn]
@603  = ~Now yer talkin'! I could use a dark dwarven ale!~
@604  = ~Tis a terrible thing to be locked in a rat cage.~ [yeslickt]
@605  = ~Trust me, I should know.~
@606  = ~Ya need a dwarf commanding the walls, ta show ye novices how defending a city is done.~ [yeslicks]
@607  = ~Yer wastin' yer time with talkin' with her. She is as mad as wet hen!~
@608  = ~I must advise against this, <CHARNAME>.  Power does things to people, such as Amelissan here.  I am begging you...do not do this.  Don't become another Amelissan, or Irenicus, or Bodhi.~
@609  = ~Stay mortal, keep your wits about you.  Consider this decision carefully.  Weigh *everything* up before you decide.~
@610  = ~It warms my old bones ta see such a young face.~ [yeslicko]
@611  = ~I think I should tell ya that I disagree with what he have been doin'.~
@612  = ~There be dark horizons if we don't change our ways.~ [Yeslick2]
@613  = ~When are ye going ta let me show ya how ta really drink beer lass? I'm tired of havin' ta babysit ya.~
@614  = ~What are you talking about Yeslick? I can drink as much as you!~
@615  = ~Aye, but It'll take ye a week ta drink a nights worth fer me. Face it, Imoen, ya humans canna drink like us dwarves.~
@616  = ~Oh yeah? In that case, I challenge you!~
@617  = ~Ya challenge me? Harharharharha... Yer going ta need ta put a nipple on yer pint, lassie, ther is no way ya are ever going ta out drink a dwarf.~
@618  = ~Yeah, I challenge you! Only I want it to be wine, not beer that we drink.~
@619  = ~Wine? I dunna wanna be drinkin' no sour grapes, ya hear me?~
@620  = ~So you forfeit?~
@621  = ~I didna say that lass! If ye want a wine challenge, ye got one!~
@622  = ~If ye try anythin', I'll split yer skull! Ya hear me, Sarevok?~
@623  = ~Yes, I hear you dwarf, but your threats are meaningless. In fact, I could probably talk <CHARNAME> into kicking you out of he group. That is how much influence I have over matters.~
@624  = ~Shut yer mouth ya bloody bastard! I dunna care if <CHARNAME> trusts ya.. I say that when this is over, ye gots ta pay fer all the people that ye killed, ya troll dung!~
@625  = ~I would gladly add your skull to the pile of my victims if you should wish it, dwarf.~
@626  = ~The only thing yer goin' ta pile up, is the mountain of horse dung ya have been spreadin' since ya joined.~
@627  = ~By Clangeddin's Silverbeard! I have never seen someone take ta the warrior arts as fast as ye have, Aerie.~
@628  = ~I supposse that traveling with <CHARNAME> has sped up my learning curve.~
@629  = ~Truthfully, I never thought I would ever be going on adventures like this after being locked in a cage at the circus for so long.~
@630  = ~Aye! Ye and me both, lassie. I know something about being locked in a cage.~
@631  = ~It must have been interesting traveling with <CHARNAME> when <PRO_HESHE> was still learning to be an adventurer.. Ever since I have known <PRO_HIMHER>, <PRO_HESHE> has seemed like such a seasoned warrior.~
@632  = ~Even before we find out that <PRO_HESHE> was a Bhaalspawn, <PRO_HESHE> was still quite skilled. Saved my arse, <PRO_HESHE> did, and then defeated that half-orc cleric of Cyric, Mulahey, who was sent by Tazok ta sabotage the Nashkel mines on behalf of Sarevok and the Iron Throne.~
@633  = ~Sounds like an epic story.~
@634  = ~Aye, it was.. But ta be honest, twas nothing compared ta the battles we have been fighting as of late.~
@635  = ~Ye are swift with a blade and have a strong back.. Ye would have made a fine dwarven miner, Anomen.~
@636  = ~I hardly think that a knight of the Order could display true virtue by digging holes.~
@637  = ~Oh really? I'll have ya know that miners are some of the toughest dwarves there are. Avalanches, rockslides, pools of magma, pitfalls and all kinds monsters and baddies lurking in the shadows of the deep... Ye risk yer life everyday doing what they do, all for the good of the clan.~
@638  = ~You mean so that they can fill their coffers with gems.~
@639  = ~Ensuring the financial vitality of yer clan is fer the common good. Ya need ta pay blacksmiths in gems if ye want the weapons ye need ta protect yerself from goblikins and drow that dwell underground.~
@640  = ~Such an inhospitable place to live!~
@641  = ~Aye. But it comes with its rewards and well as its hardships. Afterall, it was in the underground of the craggy depths beneath the great mountains that the ancient dwarves learned the secret of metalcraft and weapon making and taught it ta early man.~
@642  = ~That may be, but I still believe the a knight of the Order would be of better use serving those of us that do not live in caves.~
@643  = ~Perhaps ye are right. Yer horses would be too scared ta go underground and ye would be no could in the dark without Darkvision.~
@644  = ~Garrick, ye bonehead! Put down that blasted quill and parchment and keep an eye out. We could be attacked at any time!~
@645  = ~Fear not, Yeslick! Brave Sir Garrick would never let anything happen to the party under his watch.~ [garrickp]
@646  = ~Stop foolin' about, boy! Ye wouldna know the color of shite if ye mother haddna told ya!~
@647  = ~Language, language..~ [garrick8]
@648  = ~Just keep yer eyes open and stay focused, will ya!?  I dunna want a repeat of what happened with Arghain and his clan of Half-Ogres in the Lonely Peaks.~
@649  = ~Okay, so I forgot my backpack, which was full of heal potions at the inn... It can happen to anyone!~
@650  = ~*Grrr* Just watch our back! And this time, dun't ya let three half-ogres sneak behind us without so much as a peep!~
@651  = ~I told you, they were ninja-ogres!~
@652  = ~We'd have heard 'em if yer damn ballads haddna been echoing throughout the valley because of yer horrible singin'!~
@653  = ~Sheesh! Everyone is a critic!~ [garrickz]
@654  = ~Ooooh! Isn't this all so exciting, Yeslick? I can't believe all the things that <CHARNAME> since we met <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@655  = ~Exciting inna the word that I would use, lassie!~
@656  = ~Oh Yeslick, must you always be such a grouch! Come on! This has to be the most exciting thing that has ever happened to either one of us.~
@657  = ~Aye! But it's also the most dangerous as well! A dwarf could break his neck trying to keep up with dem young, reckless Bhaalspawns.~
@658  = ~Stop acting like you are SO old! You don't look a day over one hundred.~
@659  = ~I thank ye fer yer kind words, lass, but it's gonna take more than a compliment from a pretty lady ta make me ferget all the terrors I have seen of the battlefield.~
@660  = ~You need to stop focusing on all the bad stuff and keep your happy thoughts close to your heart.~
@661  = ~Ta be young again...~
@662  = ~Must you always be fetting about, dwarf? UGH! I can't take a step without feeling like I'm going to trip over you!~
@663  = ~Shut yer mouth, ye twangy sounding bard! Yer ego is positively elven!~ [Yeslickn]
@664  = ~*sigh* That is the difficulty with dwarves.. they get too emotional..~
@665  = ~If ye keep barkin' at me bard, I'm gunna treat ya like the flea-ridden dog ye are.~
@666  = ~Oh! I'm so scared! Look everyone! There is an angry dwarf here with a stick and he's pointing it at me!~
@667  = ~*burp* Yer more funny when I'm drunk!~
@668  = ~Minsc, have I told ye about the time that I came across an abandoned dragon's den, back when I was a young dwarf, mining too deeply with some of my clanmates?~
@669  = ~No you have not. Please, do go on.. Boo is most interested in hearing what happened next. Did you battle a the dragon?~
@670  = ~Nay! As luck would have it, the first thing we came across in this massive chamber was the skeletal remains of the dragon. Seems it had died long ago.~
@671  = ~So you plundered the dragon's treasure horde! What joy!~
@672  = ~Aye, that is what we thought was going ta happen. We were already thinking of the juicy gems that we were goin' ta fill our satchels with.. but as fate would have it, it didna work out that way.~
@673  = ~Why, what happened?~
@674  = ~As luck owuld have it, we arrived there shortly after a drow war party. Being young, inexperienced dwarves, they easily fought of off, and we were lucky ta escape with our lives. I myself was terribly wounded.~
@675  = ~That was the day that I decided ta give up being a miner and deicate my Moradin and the ways of battle!~
@676  = ~Great fun!~
@677  = ~You want me to leave? But I am so close to finsihing my latest ballad!~
@678  = ~We are surely at the beginning of an epic tale. Lead on!~
@679  = ~Ah well, I suppose it will give me the opportunity to work on this new ballad I've been thinking of... I bet you'll never guess who the protagonists are!~
@680  = ~You're back!  And just in time, too.  I need material for a few more verses of my tribute to our friendship. Besides, I don't think I could bear to stand around here anymore. Could I come with you? I have many skills, and I know I'd be an asset.~
@681  = ~What a desolate place this is! Why people would ever choose to live in such a place is beyond me.~
@682  = ~I bet they don't even have a tavern that is worthy of a bard of my renowned skills.~
@683  = ~Don't forget to tell you everyone that is was <CHARNAME>, along with Brave Sir Garrick that rescued you. Umm..Sir?~ [garrickp]
@684  = ~Just another innocent soul saved by <CHARNAME> and Brave Sir Garrick!~ [garrickp]
@685  = ~Ha! You've just given me an idea for the title of my latest ballad.~
@686  = ~*yawn* What is dangerous, is a bard without sleep!~
@687  = ~That's the spirit, old man! Life is glorious!~ [garrickh]
@688  = ~Gromnir and his men sound like they will make the perfect villains in the newest adventure of Brave Sir Garrick.~ [garrickp]
@689  = ~Once more unto the breach, dear friends!~ [garricka]
@690  = ~Excuse me sir, but I think you need to learn some manners.~ [garrick8]
@691  = ~This sounds like a job for Brave Sir Garrick and his merry men!~ [garrickp]
@692  = ~Turn that frown, upside down, my firends. Life always has a silver lining.~ [garrickh]
@693  = ~Well thank you so very much for that invaluable information.~ [garrick4]
@694  = ~*gulp* Yes, that's it! No doubt we've come to help with your most noble cause!~
@695  = ~I'm always looking to enjoy myself. What did you have in mind? A sing-a-long?~
@696  = ~I understand completely...~
@697  = ~You would rather play Tiddlywinks.~
@698  = ~I think you need to learn some manners.~ [garrick8]
@699  = ~Wow! the famous, Volo! What perfect timing! It just so happens that I recently finished the newest ballad of Brave Sir Garrick.~ [garrickp]
@700  = ~That is the curse of being beautiful, my dear. Everyone despises us.~ [garricko]
@701  = ~Finally, I meet someone with the same fashion taste as me!~
@702  = ~Well now.. isn't this place.. quaint.~
@703  = ~Hmmm.. Can I assume that you guys have not heard all the latest songs then?~
@704  = ~Wouldn't you rather be more like Brave, brave Sir Garrick?~ [garrickp]
@705  = ~Who is that?~
@706  = ~Only the bravest warrior in all of Faerun!~ [garrick5]
@707  = ~Sounds like a pig herder.~
@708  = ~You need to learn some manners.~ [garrick8]
@709  = ~I think you need to learn some manners!~ [garrick8]
@710  = ~No! Of course not! *rolls eyes*~
@711  = ~Hold on a minute there!~
@712  = ~You never know.. from the looks of her, begging may very well just save her life yet!~
@713  = ~Still looks pure to me.~
@714  = ~Brave Sir Garrick will not stand idle while such injustice transpires before his very eyes!~ [garrickp]
@715  = ~This guy really needs to learn some manners.~ [garrick8]
@716  = ~Brilliant! I must get that one down!~
@717  = ~Aha! And so, the Legend of Brave Sir Garrick spreads!~ [garrickp]
@718  = ~Sounds more like trash picker.~
@719  = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>, was that you? Cut it out, would you?~
@720  = ~I say we pull levers at random until something good happens.~
@721  = ~The rule with buttons it to press them all at the same time!~
@722  = ~Come on, Imoen! You have to give me something to put in the new ballad!~
@723  = ~I told you everything already, Garrick! What more do you want?~
@724  = ~Are you sure there is not anything that you have forgotten? Afterall, we have been through a lot in a short amount of time.~
@725  = ~I'm sure!~
@726  = ~Very well.. Do you mind if the actress that plays the part of you wears a different colored wig in stage show? I'm  thinking something with a little more.. pizaaz.~
@727  = ~Yes, yes...~
@728  = ~Okay, how's this?~
@729  = ~There once was a girl named, Imoen..

Whose magic could beat a demoen~
@730  = ~She was very quick

If a little bit thick

And always ready for a trick.~
@731  = ~Ugh! What terrible singing!~
@732  = ~Care for an apple, Aerie, they are nice and fresh?~
@733  = ~No thank you, Garrick.~
@734  = ~very well, suit yourself.~
@735  = ~*bite* Mmmm... Yum!~
@736  = ~Garrick, when are you finally going to learn some magic that is useful?~
@737  = ~I'll have you know, Jaheira, that we bards use maagic, not because it is useful, but because it entertains.~
@738  = ~That's hardly practical when you are traveling with a band of adventuers.~
@739  = ~Well that's why we have you around.~
@740  = ~And remind me again why it is that we keep you around?~
@741  = ~Other then for comic relief, that is..~
@742  = ~Well's that's rude!~ [garrick8]
@743  = ~But just so you know, the reason I am important is beacuse you need a skilled bard around to keep an accurate record of what really transpired. You think Volo is going to follow you around with his quill and parchment?~
@744  = ~That matters infinitely less to me than your weapon skills. Work on them!~
@745  = ~Yes, sir!~ [garrickf]
@746  = ~What do you say Mazzy? I have a harmonica in my satchel. What say we sing about the many ways we shall vanquish our foes?~
@747  = ~Settle down, Garrick! Our you out of your mind?~
@748  = ~Don't you realize that bringing that much attention on us to get us killed?~
@749  = ~Oh! You are absolutely right! We'll have to keep the song in a low key!~
@750  = ~No Garrick! No singing!~
@751  = ~No singing? *sigh* Very well.~
@752  = ~Yes.. Sorry to kill the mood.~
@753  = ~You're missing the opportunity of your life.~
@754  = ~I thought as much. Lead on, and wake me whenever we get wherever it is we are going.~
@755  = ~It is a pity. Our time together has been thoroughly charming. Perhaps we will meet again?~
@756  = ~I thought you would be crawling back. Don't be ashamed, I am quite used to it. Shall we continue on together?~
@757  = ~If I wanted to live a life of tedium, I would have become a monk.~
@758  = ~Bah! I would rather travel alone than spend a second more with you boorish oafs. Goodbye, and good riddance!~
@759  = ~Thieves should be hanged.~
@760  = ~I can think of a FEW ways that YOU could thank me now.~
@761  = ~*yawn* Sounds like somebody else's problem.~
@762  = ~Damn fool old man is going to get himself killed.~
@763  = ~*Tisk* You must learn to steal. It is the only honorable way to live.~
@764  = ~Yes.. you seem like an extremely busy man whose time is very precious..~
@765  = ~Though your breath stinks worse than a gutter.~
@766  = ~Forget your husband.. How about we talk about you getting friendly with THIS stranger?~
@767  = ~I'll ask you to leave my house NOW, or I will be forced to tell my husband of your words!~
@768  = ~Come now girl, you wouldn't want to get him killed.. and deep down, you know you want it.~
@769  = ~Leave, NOW!~
@770  = ~Yes.. so what is your point?~
@771  = ~Anyone else feel like having a glass of wine?~
@772  = ~Tell me, Skie, darling..sweetheart.. You are still not angry at me taking your innocence and then being on the dash?~
@773  = ~I think you are the lowest form of bottom feeding scum there is and if <CHARNAME> did not have some use for you, I would have stuck a dagger in your belly the minute I saw you again.. if not for the things you did to me, but for all the evil that you have done since.~
@774  = ~You wouldn't think that I was so evil if you knew how many women I have done since. No man that makes that much love is all bad.~
@775  = ~Ugh! You sicken me! To think I once considered you the love of my life.. I hate to think of how low and desperate I was back then.~
@776  = ~Admit it! I was the love of your life and you have been dying see ever since we last parted.~
@777  = ~Still as deluded and egotistical as you ever were. You were the worse thing to ever happen to me and I wish more than anything that I could just forget the whole affair.~
@778  = ~Trust me, orc-face, I will be counting the days until I never have to see you again.~
@779  = ~Love is like dark chocolate. Although it always leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, you will still be tempted to take a bite the next time around.~
@780  = ~Ugh! Leave me alone or I'll pay assassins to have you killed.~
@781  = ~Too scared to do it yourself, pussycat?~
@782  = ~It would disgust me far too much to be that close.~
@783  = ~That's not what you used to say.~
@784  = ~Rrrr!!!~
@785  = ~Mind where you swing that sword of yours, amazon, or I will have to shot a poisoned arrow into your back.~
@786  = ~You could not hit an elephant in this darkness, you useless dog!~
@787  = ~If you don't want me to 'accidentally' take off your head, I suggest you stay out of my way.~
@788  = ~Do you actually think I want you around me more than absolutely necessary.. what with your brutish ways and man-like shoulders?~
@789  = ~You are fortunate that I am not feeling particularly brutish, or I'd cut of your tongue for speaking to me in such a manner, you miserable worm!~ [shart!]
@790  = ~I do not understand why <CHARNAME> keeps a woman like you around when there are so many others out there that are far more pleasing to my eyes.~
@791  = ~Because, you spineless little fraction of a man, the big-breasted bimbos that you would have join could not match my mastery with a sword.~
@792  = ~Perhaps, but they have.. other gifts.~
@793  = ~What do you want, Bhaalspawn?~
@794  = ~Have you ever given any thought to settling down and having children?~
@795  = ~I wish to challenge to a sparring match, Nightbringer.~
@796  = ~Why are you always so angry?~
@797  = ~Don't be stupid! The only thing that matters to me is to be the last Nightbringer standing when the next Avatar War begins.~
@798  = ~Please! I would make you my lickspittle and we would lose countless days while you healed.~
@799  = ~Fool! The only time that I enjoy myself is after crushing my enemies. All my other time is focused on becoming a better killer.~
@800  = ~So, this is the infamous, Watcher's Keep. Rumor has it that Helm imprisoned a dark demon within the walls of the castle.~
@801  = ~Be on guard. There are far worse things than orcs in this place.~
@802  = ~If anyone is going to kill that rotgutted sea dog, it's going to me!~
@803  = ~Let's teach this miserable sand eating lizard a lesson!~
@804  = ~This damned fool has lost his mind!~
@805  = ~Be on guard! I feel death creeping in every shadow around us.~
@806  = ~Finally, a real battle! Eat steel, SCUM!~ [sharta]
@807  = ~More carrion for the vultures.~ [shartw]
@808  = ~Why would we want to hire a bunch a worthless jackals like you?~
@809  = ~As if it was going to make a difference.. Useless male dung heap!~ [shart7]
@810  = ~It's so pathetic how all the spineless vermin of this camel-ridden town fear this, Balthazar.~
@811  = ~Then what good are you, fool!?~
@812  = ~You don't even have a wineskin to drink from, old man? I should chop off your head!~
@813  = ~You have much more to fear than just a Bhaalspawn, fool! I am a Nightbringer of Shar and as such, would have no problem slicing your spine in two.~
@814  = ~I going to enjoy stabbing my blade into your chest and seeing your blood spill onto the floor.~
@815  = ~Shall we help this fool save his daughter? My blade is in need of fresh blood.~
@816  = ~You are meaning to tell me that we risked our necks for a measly five hundred gold coins?~
@817  = ~That is not even enough to buy healing potions with... Useless male dung heap!~ [shart7]
@818  = ~I'll stand wherever I please! Useless male dung heap!~ [shart7]
@819  = ~Why do you think we want the key, fool? We wanrt his blood too!~
@820  = ~I am going to enjoy killing you, Bhaalspawn! Eat steel, SCUM!~ [sharta]
@821  = ~I think not.~
@822  = ~Where I'm from, people do what I want or I cut off their head!~
@823  = ~Useless male dung heap!~ [shart7]
@824  = ~We defeated that demon once, and we'll defeat him again, in the midst of the flames of hell if need be!~ [shartw]
@825  = ~You jackals need a new strategy. While you are dying up here, defending these walls, the city rots from within.~
@826  = ~I saw two starving children eating a dead horse for food. Something has to change or this will not end well.~
@827  = ~That is not my duty. I just defend the walls.~
@828  = ~Useless male dung heap! If a strong woman like me were in charge, this siege would have been crushed long ago!~ [shart7]
@829  = ~The dog has a point, we could be killed out here.~

@1095 = ~Sarevok, your destiny is a ready made ballad. We bards would never dream of such a thing! Son of the Lord of Murder, an epic confrontation with a divine relative, defeat and imprisonment in Hell, but then... Ah, amazing.~
@1096 = ~Heh heh... but you would have added something else, right? Actually, you are also a minstrel who makes no mistakes, since you have come so far. An interesting and challenging story unfolds...~
@1097 = ~Yes, and we're both part of it. It's great that you and <CHARNAME> are now on the same side.~
@1098 = ~Of course we are, I made an oath not to betray <PRO_HIMHER>. Oaths done through our father's blood possess more power than you can image. As you can already witness that *I* the Mighty Sarevok, working together with my sibling who had slain me before. Never under estimate the power of the divine.~
@1106 = ~Absolutely fascinating! I need to write this down...~ [GARRICK7]
@1107 = ~Of course. I will not betray <PRO_HIMHER>.~

// Garrick - Aerie 2
@1099 = ~Garrick, I'm returning the book you gave me to read, with gratitude!~
@1100 = ~I can see from your wonderful smile that you liked it.~ [GARRICKG]
@1101 = ~Oh yes. How wise and beautiful it is...~
@1102 = ~“O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour which doth in it live..."~
@1103 = ~You know, once... I didn't know people at all. I f-found this out from the most terrible side. But with experience, I gradually discovered the other side of your race. You are so different. The most sophisticated of you know how to create beauty no worse than the elves. You taught me a lot too, and I thank you.~
@1104 = ~Did I teach? But I didn't teach anything... and I don't preach anything either. I just sing songs and tell stories.~
@1105 = ~Garrick... isn't that enough?~
